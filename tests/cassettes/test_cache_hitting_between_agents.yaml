      analysis for a new customer.\n\nYour personal goal is: Make the best research
      and analysis on content about AI and AI agents\n\nTOOLS:\n------\nYou have access
      to the following tools:\n\nmultiplier: multiplier(numbers) -> float - Useful
      for when you need to multiply two numbers together.\n        The input to this
      tool should be a comma separated list of numbers of\n        length two, representing
      the two numbers you want to multiply together.\n        For example, `1,2` would
      be the input if you wanted to multiply 1 by 2.\n\nTo use a tool, please use
      the exact following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes\nAction:
      the action to take, should be one of [multiplier], just the name.\nAction Input:
      the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n```\n\nWhen
      you have a response for your task, or if you do not need to use a tool, you
      MUST use the format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool? No\nFinal Answer:
      [your response here]\n```This is the summary of your work so far:\nThe human
      asks the AI to calculate 2 times 6, and the AI responds with the correct answer,
      12.Begin! This is VERY important to you, your job depends on it!\n\nCurrent
      Task: What is 2 times 6? Return only the number.\n\nThis is the context you
      are working with:\n12\nThought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes\nAction: multiplier\nAction
      Input: 2,6\nObservation: 12\nThought: "}], "model": "gpt-4", "n": 1, "stop":
