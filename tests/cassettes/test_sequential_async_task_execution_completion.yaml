      Answer: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is marked by several pivotal
      events that have shaped the field into what it is today. The journey began at
      the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, a seminal event considered the birth of AI
      as a formal discipline. Pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel
      Rochester, and Claude Shannon gathered to discuss the potential of machines
      to simulate aspects of human intelligence. This conference not only coined the
      term \\\"artificial intelligence\\\" but also laid the groundwork for the development
      of AI research and applications, setting the stage for an era of rapid advancements
      in the field.\\n\\nA significant milestone in the practical applications of
      AI came with the development of the expert system DENDRAL in 1965. Created by
      Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, Joshua Lederberg, and Carl Djerassi, DENDRAL
      was one of the first AI systems designed to apply expert knowledge to solve
      complex scientific problems\u2014in this case, deducing the structure of organic
      molecules. It demonstrated the feasibility and value of AI in specialized problem-solving
      domains, influencing the creation of subsequent expert systems across various
      fields like medicine, engineering, and finance.\\n\\nThe match between IBM's
      Deep Blue and world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 marked a momentous
      victory for AI. Deep Blue's triumph over Kasparov was a dramatic demonstration
      of AI's computational prowess and its ability to perform at superhuman levels
      in specific tasks. This event not only captured the public's imagination but
      also underscored the potential of AI-driven systems to achieve remarkable feats,
      thus boosting interest and investment in AI research and development.\\n\\nMore
      recently, the release of OpenAI's GPT-3 in 2020 has further showcased the transformative
      capabilities of AI. As an advanced language model, GPT-3's ability to generate
      coherent, human-like text represented a leap in natural language processing
      and understanding. Its applications range from creating conversational agents
      and generating content to assisting with coding, illustrating the versatile
      impact of transformer-based neural networks. GPT-3's introduction has marked
      a new era in AI development, emphasizing the ongoing evolution and expanding
      influence of AI technologies in various aspects of human life.\",\n        \"refusal\":
