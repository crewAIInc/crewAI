      Answer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents are sophisticated computer programs
      designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
      decision making, problem-solving, and learning. These agents operate autonomously,
      utilizing vast amounts of data, advanced algorithms, and machine learning techniques
      to analyze their environment, adapt to new information, and improve their performance
      over time. The significance of AI Agents lies in their transformative potential
      across various industries. In healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases
      with greater accuracy; in finance, they predict market trends and manage risks;
      in customer service, they provide personalized and efficient responses. As these
      AI-powered entities continue to evolve, they are not only enhancing operational
      efficiencies but also driving innovation and creating new opportunities for
      growth and development in every sector they penetrate.\",\n        \"refusal\":
