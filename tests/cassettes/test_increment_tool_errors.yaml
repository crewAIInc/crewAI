      implications for sustainable development.\\n\\n2. Title: \\\"The Evolution of
      Social Media: Trends and Forecasts\\\"\\n   Score: 4\\n   Reason: Highly relevant
      and timely, clear implications, and increasingly impactful, though somewhat
      narrow in focus compared to some other topics.\\n\\n3. Title: \\\"History of
      Medieval Art in Europe\\\"\\n   Score: 2\\n   Reason: While of academic interest,
      it lacks immediate relevance to current societal trends and has limited impact
      on present and future societal issues.\\n\\n4. Title: \\\"Quantum Computing
      and Its Applications in Cryptography\\\"\\n   Score: 5\\n   Reason: Very relevant
      to current technological trends, high potential for innovation, and significant
      implications for security and other fields.\\n\\n5. Title: \\\"Traditional Farming
      Methods in Rural America\\\"\\n   Score: 3\\n   Reason: Relevant within certain
      contexts such as cultural preservation and localized sustainability, but limited
      in broader impact or innovation.\\n\\nThought: I now have a better understanding
      of how to score titles based on relevance, innovation potential, clarity of
      implications, and breadth of impact.\\n\\nFinal Answer: Based on the criteria
      and examples provided, the title 'The Impact of AI in the Future of Work' is
      highly relevant to current technological and societal trends, has substantial
      potential for innovation, clearly implies significant changes, and broadly impacts
      the future work landscape. Given these factors, I would score the title a 5.\",\n

      significant future impact or innovation.\\n\\n4. Example Title: \\\"Innovations
      in Renewable Energy: A Path to a Sustainable Future\\\"\\n   Score: 5\\n   Explanation:
      This title scores highly due to its strong relevance to current global issues
      (sustainability and renewable energy), its potential to highlight significant
