<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/crewai_logo.png" alt="crewAI Logo" width="500"></p>

## Short Description
`crewAI` is a powerful, cutting-edge framework designed to empower developers and researchers to build, run, and orchestrate intelligent, collaborative AI agents. It enables the creation of multi-agent systems that work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks through collective intelligence, role-playing, and dynamic tool utilization. From sophisticated data analysis to creative content generation, `crewAI` unlocks new dimensions of automation and problem-solving, allowing you to deploy truly autonomous AI teams.

## âœ¨ Key Features
*   **Intelligent Agent Orchestration:** Define and manage autonomous AI agents with distinct roles, goals, and backstories for specialized expertise and collaborative execution.

*   **CLI:** A command-line interface facilitates project creation, deployment, and management.
*   **Data Handling:** Utilizes Pydantic for data validation and parsing, and supports various data storage solutions for RAG and memory.
*   **Workflow Engine:** Orchestrates complex `flows` and `processes` (sequential, hierarchical) using advanced reasoning and planning mechanisms.
*   **Observability:** Integrates with popular tracing and logging platforms for real-time monitoring and debugging.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
The `crewAI` framework is designed around a collaborative multi-agent paradigm, where specialized agents work together, leveraging shared knowledge and tools, orchestrated by a central crew.

This diagram illustrates the core components: User input initiates a `Crew`, which orchestrates multiple `Agents`. Each `Agent` has a defined `Role` and `Goal`, potentially leveraging a specific `LLM` and a set of `Tools` to execute `Tasks`. Agents can `Collaborate` by delegating tasks or sharing information. `Memory` and `Knowledge Bases` (including RAG) provide context and data, while `Human in the Loop` ensures oversight. The collective effort culminates in a `Final Output` for the user.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get your first AI Crew up and running with `crewAI`, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Installation:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.
    ```bash
    pip install crewai
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Set your OpenAI API key (or equivalent for your chosen LLM).
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

3.  **Create Your First Crew:**
    A simple example defining a `Researcher` agent and a `Writer` agent, collaborating on a research task:

    ```python
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

    # Define your agents
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Senior Research Analyst',
        goal='Uncover groundbreaking insights from various data sources',
        backstory='A meticulous analyst, skilled in extracting critical information and trends.',
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False
    )

    writer = Agent(
        role='Content Strategist',
        goal='Craft compelling and insightful articles',
        backstory='A visionary writer, transforming complex research into engaging narratives.',
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False
    )

    # Define your tasks
    task1 = Task(
        description='Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest AI trends in 2024.',
        expected_output='A detailed report on AI advancements and market impact.',
        agent=researcher
    )

    task2 = Task(
        description='Write a blog post about the findings from the AI trends report.',
        expected_output='A 500-word engaging blog post, ready for publication.',
        agent=writer,
        context=[task1]
    )

    # Instantiate your crew
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[researcher, writer],
        tasks=[task1, task2],
        process=Process.sequential,
        verbose=2,
    )

    # Kickoff the crew
    print("CrewAI starting your research and writing process...\n")
    result = crew.kickoff()
    print("\n\n########################")
    print("## Here is the Final Result")
    print("########################\n")
    print(result)
    ```

This example creates two agents, assigns them distinct tasks with dependencies, and runs them as a sequential process.
