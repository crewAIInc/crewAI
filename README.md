## Creating Custom Tools

CrewAI offers two straightforward approaches to creating custom tools:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

Define your tool by subclassing:

```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Tool Name"
    description: str = "Detailed description here."

    def _run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Your tool logic here
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

Quickly create lightweight tools using decorators:

```python
from crewai import tool

@tool("Tool Name")
def my_custom_function(input):
    # Tool logic here
    return output
```
