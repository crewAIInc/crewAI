## Why CrewAI?

The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer.
CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

## Getting Started

### Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two powerful, complementary approaches that work seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:

1. **Crews**: Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:
   - Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents
   - Dynamic task delegation and collaboration
   - Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise
   - Flexible problem-solving approaches

2. **Flows**: Precise, event-driven workflows that give you granular control over your automation. Flows provide:
   - Low-level control over execution paths
   - Seamless state management between tasks
   - Clean integration of AI agents with Python code
   - Conditional branching for complex scenarios

The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:
- Build complex, production-grade applications
- Balance autonomy with precise control
- Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Getting Started with Installation

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, install CrewAI:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```
The command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ my_project/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ crew.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ custom_tool.py
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
        â””â”€â”€ config/
            â”œâ”€â”€ agents.yaml
            â””â”€â”€ tasks.yaml
```

You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.

#### To customize your project, you can:

- Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.
- Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.
- Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
- Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
- Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.

#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

Instantiate your crew:

```shell
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
```

Modify the files as needed to fit your use case:

**agents.yaml**

```yaml
# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: >
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

**tasks.yaml**

```yaml
# src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2024.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

**crew.py**

```python
# src/my_project/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
	"""LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

	@agent
	def researcher(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
			verbose=True,
			tools=[SerperDevTool()]
		)

	@agent
	def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
			verbose=True
		)

	@task
	def research_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
		)

	@task
	def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
			output_file='report.md'
		)

	@crew
	def crew(self) -> Crew:
		"""Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

**main.py**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/my_project/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:

- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
- A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd my_project
crewai install (Optional)
```

To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If an error happens due to the usage of poetry, please run the following command to update your crewai package:

```bash
crewai update
```

You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the full final report.

In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. [See more about the processes here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Processes/).

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Agent Design**: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.
- **Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation**: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.
- **Flexible Task Management**: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.
- **Processes Driven**: Currently only supports `sequential` task execution and `hierarchical` processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.
- **Save output as file**: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.
- **Parse output as Pydantic or Json**: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.
- **Works with Open Source Models**: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!
- **Event-Driven Flows**: Build powerful workflows that connect multiple Crews and tasks seamlessly. Flows provide structured orchestration with event-driven logic, state management between tasks, and conditional execution paths for complex automation scenarios.

### Using Crews and Flows Together

CrewAI's power truly shines when combining Crews with Flows to create sophisticated automation pipelines. Here's how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )
        
        analysis_task = Task(
            description=f"Analyze {market_data['sector']} sector data for the past {market_data['timeframe']}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
            agent=analyst
        )
        research_task = Task(
            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",
            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",
            agent=researcher
        )
        
        # Demonstrate crew autonomy
        analysis_crew = Crew(
            agents=[analyst, researcher],
            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        return analysis_crew.kickoff()

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        # Show flow control with conditional routing
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        # Demonstrate complex decision making
        strategy_crew = Crew(
            agents=[
                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",
                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")
            ],
            tasks=[
                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",
                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")
            ]
        )
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen("medium_confidence", "low_confidence")
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Use Python code for basic data operations
2. Create and execute Crews as steps in your workflow
3. Use Flow decorators to manage the sequence of operations
4. Implement conditional branching based on Crew results

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.

Please refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI revolutionizes AI orchestration by seamlessly combining autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control. While other frameworks excel in either agents or workflows, CrewAI's unique synthesis of Crews and Flows delivers unmatched capabilities for complex, production-grade applications.

- **LangGraph**: While LangGraph offers workflow orchestration, CrewAI provides a more comprehensive and intuitive solution:
  - **True Agent Autonomy**: CrewAI's Crews enable sophisticated multi-agent collaboration with:
    - Natural delegation and coordination between agents
    - Rich agent personalities and specialized expertise
    - Dynamic task adaptation based on context
    - Autonomous decision-making capabilities
  
  - **Precision Control**: CrewAI's Flows provide granular control without sacrificing simplicity:
    - Structured state management with Pydantic models
    - Event-driven architecture for complex workflows
    - Clean integration of Python code with AI agents
    - Robust error handling and recovery
  
  - **Production-Ready Features**: CrewAI excels in real-world applications:
    - Seamless combination of autonomous agents with structured workflows
    - Built-in support for complex branching and routing
    - Flexible state persistence and management
    - Comprehensive error handling and debugging
  
  - **Developer Experience**: CrewAI prioritizes maintainability and ease of use:
    - Clear separation of concerns between Flows and Crews
    - Intuitive API design that follows Python best practices
    - Extensive documentation and examples
    - Strong type safety with Pydantic integration

- **Autogen**: While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.

- **ChatDev**: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry to collect usage data with the main purpose of helping us improve the library by focusing our efforts on the most used features, integrations and tools.

It's pivotal to understand that **NO data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned. When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.

Data collected includes:

- Version of CrewAI
  - So we can understand how many users are using the latest version
- Version of Python
  - So we can decide on what versions to better support
- General OS (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux)
  - So we know what OS we should focus on and if we could build specific OS related features
- Number of agents and tasks in a crew
  - So we make sure we are testing internally with similar use cases and educate people on the best practices
- Crew Process being used
  - Understand where we should focus our efforts
- If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation
  - Understand if we improved the features or maybe even drop them
- If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially
  - Understand if we should focus more on parallel execution
- Language model being used
  - Improved support on most used languages
- Roles of agents in a crew
  - Understand high level use cases so we can build better tools, integrations and examples about it
- Tools names available
  - Understand out of the publicly available tools, which ones are being used the most so we can improve them

Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user's choice to share.
