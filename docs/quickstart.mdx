## Build your first CrewAI Agent

Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed. 
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get crewing! üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
  Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal.
  This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">  
  <Tip>
  You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
  Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
  </Tip>
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
    researcher:
      role: >
        {topic} Senior Data Researcher
      goal: >

        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
      agent: reporting_analyst
      output_file: report.md
    ```
  </Step>   
  <Step title="Modify your `crew.py` file">  
    ```python crew.py
    # src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      @agent
      def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
          config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
          verbose=True,
          tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

      @agent
      def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
          config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
          verbose=True
        )

      @task
      def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
        )

      @task
      def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
          output_file='output/report.md' # This is the file that will be contain the final report.
        )

      @crew
      def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
        return Crew(
          agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
          tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
          process=Process.sequential,
          verbose=True,
        ) 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew"> 
  For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.
    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # src/latest_ai_development/main.py
    import sys
    from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
  Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    - An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
    - A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd latest-ai-development
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
  To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your final report">
  You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

  Here's an example of what the report should look like:

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file. 
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>  

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### Annotations include:

* `@agent`
* `@task`
* `@crew`
* `@tool`
* `@callback`
* `@output_json`
* `@output_pydantic`
* `@cache_handler`

```python crew.py
# ...
@agent
def email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["email_summarizer"],
    )

@task
def email_summarizer_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["email_summarizer_task"],
    )
# ...
```

<Tip>
In addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),
which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. 
You can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).
</Tip>

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memory
```

This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.

## Deploying Your Project

The easiest way to deploy your crew is through [CrewAI Enterprise](http://app.crewai.com/), where you can deploy your crew in a few clicks.
