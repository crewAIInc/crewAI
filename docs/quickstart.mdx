## Build your first CrewAI Agent

Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get crewing! 🚣‍♂️

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
  Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal.
  This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">
  <Tip>
  You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
  Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
  </Tip>
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
    researcher:
      role: >
        {topic} Senior Data Researcher
      goal: >
        Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
      backstory: >
        You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
        developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
        information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

    reporting_analyst:
      role: >
        {topic} Reporting Analyst
      goal: >
        Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
      backstory: >
        You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
        your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
        it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `tasks.yaml` file">
    ```yaml tasks.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml
    research_task:
      description: >
        Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2024.
      expected_output: >
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
      agent: researcher

    reporting_task:
      description: >
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
      expected_output: >
        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
      agent: reporting_analyst
      output_file: report.md
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `crew.py` file">
    ```python crew.py
    # src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      @before_kickoff
      def before_kickoff_function(self, inputs):
        print(f"Before kickoff function with inputs: {inputs}")
        return inputs # You can return the inputs or modify them as needed

      @after_kickoff
      def after_kickoff_function(self, result):
        print(f"After kickoff function with result: {result}")
        return result # You can return the result or modify it as needed

      @callback
      def log_progress(self, task: Task, output: str):
        """Log task completion progress."""
        print(f"\n{'='*50}")
        print(f"Task Completed: {task.description}")
        print(f"Agent: {task.agent.role}")
        print(f"Output Length: {len(output)} characters")
        print(f"Completed at: {datetime.now().isoformat()}")
        print(f"{'='*50}\n")

      # ... remaining code
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew">
  For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.
    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # src/latest_ai_development/main.py
    import sys
    from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
  Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    - An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
    - A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd latest-ai-development
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
  To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your final report">
  You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

  Here's an example of what the report should look like:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```markdown output/report.md

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### Annotations include:

Here are examples of how to use each annotation in your CrewAI project, and when you should use them:

#### @agent
Used to define an agent in your crew. Use this when:
- You need to create a specialized AI agent with a specific role
- You want the agent to be automatically collected and managed by the crew
- You need to reuse the same agent configuration across multiple tasks

```python
@agent
def research_agent(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        role="Research Analyst",
        goal="Conduct thorough research on given topics",
        backstory="Expert researcher with years of experience in data analysis",
        tools=[SerperDevTool()],
        verbose=True
    )
```

#### @task
Used to define a task that can be executed by agents. Use this when:
- You need to define a specific piece of work for an agent
- You want tasks to be automatically sequenced and managed
- You need to establish dependencies between different tasks

```python
@task
def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        description="Research the latest developments in AI technology",
        expected_output="A comprehensive report on AI advancements",
        agent=self.research_agent(),
        output_file="output/research.md"
    )
```

#### @crew
Used to define your crew configuration. Use this when:
- You want to automatically collect all @agent and @task definitions
- You need to specify how tasks should be processed (sequential or hierarchical)
- You want to set up crew-wide configurations

```python
@crew
def research_crew(self) -> Crew:
    return Crew(
        agents=self.agents,  # Automatically collected from @agent methods
        tasks=self.tasks,    # Automatically collected from @task methods
        process=Process.sequential,
        verbose=True
    )
```

#### @tool
Used to create custom tools for your agents. Use this when:
- You need to give agents specific capabilities (like web search, data analysis)
- You want to encapsulate external API calls or complex operations
- You need to share functionality across multiple agents

```python
@tool
def web_search_tool(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> list[str]:
    """
    Search the web for information.

    Args:
        query: The search query
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return

    Returns:
        List of search results
    """
    # Implement your search logic here
    return [f"Result {i} for: {query}" for i in range(max_results)]
```

#### @before_kickoff
Used to execute logic before the crew starts. Use this when:
- You need to validate or preprocess input data
- You want to set up resources or configurations before execution
- You need to perform any initialization logic

```python
@before_kickoff
def validate_inputs(self, inputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Validate and preprocess inputs before the crew starts."""
    if inputs is None:
        return None
        
    if 'topic' not in inputs:
        raise ValueError("Topic is required")
    
    # Add additional context
    inputs['timestamp'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    inputs['topic'] = inputs['topic'].strip().lower()
    return inputs
```

#### @after_kickoff
Used to process results after the crew completes. Use this when:
- You need to format or transform the final output
- You want to perform cleanup operations
- You need to save or log the results in a specific way

```python
@after_kickoff
def process_results(self, result: CrewOutput) -> CrewOutput:
    """Process and format the results after the crew completes."""
    result.raw = result.raw.strip()
    result.raw = f"""
    # Research Results
    Generated on: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
    
    {result.raw}
    """
    return result
```

#### @callback
Used to handle events during crew execution. Use this when:
- You need to monitor task progress
- You want to log intermediate results
- You need to implement custom progress tracking or metrics

```python
@callback
def log_task_completion(self, task: Task, output: str):
    """Log task completion details for monitoring."""
    print(f"Task '{task.description}' completed")
    print(f"Output length: {len(output)} characters")
    print(f"Agent used: {task.agent.role}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

#### @cache_handler
Used to implement custom caching for task results. Use this when:
- You want to avoid redundant expensive operations
- You need to implement custom cache storage or expiration logic
- You want to persist results between runs

```python
@cache_handler
def custom_cache(self, key: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Custom cache implementation for storing task results."""
    cache_file = f"cache/{key}.json"
    
    if os.path.exists(cache_file):
        with open(cache_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            # Check if cache is still valid (e.g., not expired)
            if datetime.fromisoformat(data['timestamp']) > datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1):
                return data['result']
    return None
```

<Note>
These decorators are part of the CrewAI framework and help organize your crew's structure by automatically collecting agents, tasks, and handling various lifecycle events. 
They should be used within a class decorated with `@CrewBase`.
</Note>

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memories --all
```

This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.
