## Build your first CrewAI Agent

Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have finished installing CrewAI.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get Crewing! 🚣‍♂️

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
  Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal.
  This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to your new crew project">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd latest_ai_development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">
  <Tip>
  You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
  Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
  </Tip>
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
    researcher:
      role: >
        {topic} Senior Data Researcher
      goal: >
        Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
      backstory: >
        You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
        developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
        information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

    reporting_analyst:
      role: >
        {topic} Reporting Analyst
      goal: >
        Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
      backstory: >
        You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
        your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
        it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `tasks.yaml` file">
    ```yaml tasks.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml
    research_task:
      description: >
        Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2025.
      expected_output: >
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
      agent: researcher

    reporting_task:
      description: >
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
      expected_output: >
        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
      agent: reporting_analyst
      output_file: report.md
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `crew.py` file">
    ```python crew.py
    # src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
    from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
    from typing import List

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      agents: List[BaseAgent]
      tasks: List[Task]

      @agent
      def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
          config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
          verbose=True,
          tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

      @agent
      def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:

          agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
          tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
          process=Process.sequential,
          verbose=True,
        )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Add before and after crew functions">
    ```python crew.py
    # src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      @before_kickoff
      def before_kickoff_function(self, inputs):
        print(f"Before kickoff function with inputs: {inputs}")
        return inputs # You can return the inputs or modify them as needed

      @after_kickoff
      def after_kickoff_function(self, result):
        print(f"After kickoff function with result: {result}")
        return result # You can return the result or modify it as needed

      # ... remaining code
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew">
  For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.
    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # src/latest_ai_development/main.py
    import sys
    from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
  Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    - A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
    - The configuration for your choice of model, such as an API key. See the
        [LLM setup guide](/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm) to learn how to configure models from any provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    - Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
      <CodeGroup>
        ```shell Terminal
        crewai install
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
    - If you have additional packages that you want to install, you can do so by running:
      <CodeGroup>
        ```shell Terminal
        uv add <package-name>
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
    - To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Terminal
        crewai run
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enterprise Alternative: Create in Crew Studio">

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: provider/model-id  # Add your choice of model here
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the task in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```
