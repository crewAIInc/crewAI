## Build your first CrewAI Agent

Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get crewing! üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
  Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal.
  This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">
  <Tip>
  You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
  Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
  </Tip>
    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
    researcher:
      role: >
        {topic} Senior Data Researcher
      goal: >
        Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
      backstory: >
        You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
        developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
        information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

    reporting_analyst:
      role: >
        {topic} Reporting Analyst
      goal: >
        Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
      backstory: >

        )

      @task
      def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
        )

      @task
      def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
          config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
          output_file='output/report.md' # This is the file that will be contain the final report.
        )

      @crew
      def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
        return Crew(
          agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
          tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
          process=Process.sequential,
          verbose=True,
        )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="[Optional] Add before and after crew functions">
    ```python crew.py
    # src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
    from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
    from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    @CrewBase
    class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
      """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

      @before_kickoff
      def before_kickoff_function(self, inputs):
        print(f"Before kickoff function with inputs: {inputs}")
        return inputs # You can return the inputs or modify them as needed

      @after_kickoff
      def after_kickoff_function(self, result):
        print(f"After kickoff function with result: {result}")
        return result # You can return the result or modify it as needed

      # ... remaining code
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew">
  For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.
    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # src/latest_ai_development/main.py
    import sys
    from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
  Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    - An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
    - A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd latest-ai-development
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your crew">
  To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your final report">
  You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: openai/gpt-4o
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### Annotations include:

Here are examples of how to use each annotation in your CrewAI project, and when you should use them:

#### @agent
Used to define an agent in your crew. Use this when:
- You need to create a specialized AI agent with a specific role
- You want the agent to be automatically collected and managed by the crew
- You need to reuse the same agent configuration across multiple tasks

```python
@agent
def research_agent(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        role="Research Analyst",
        goal="Conduct thorough research on given topics",
        backstory="Expert researcher with years of experience in data analysis",
        tools=[SerperDevTool()],
        verbose=True
    )
```

#### @task
Used to define a task that can be executed by agents. Use this when:
- You need to define a specific piece of work for an agent
- You want tasks to be automatically sequenced and managed
- You need to establish dependencies between different tasks

```python
@task
def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        description="Research the latest developments in AI technology",
        expected_output="A comprehensive report on AI advancements",
        agent=self.research_agent(),
        output_file="output/research.md"
    )
```

#### @crew
Used to define your crew configuration. Use this when:
- You want to automatically collect all @agent and @task definitions
- You need to specify how tasks should be processed (sequential or hierarchical)
- You want to set up crew-wide configurations

```python
@crew
def research_crew(self) -> Crew:
    return Crew(
        agents=self.agents,  # Automatically collected from @agent methods
        tasks=self.tasks,    # Automatically collected from @task methods
        process=Process.sequential,
        verbose=True
    )
```

#### @tool
Used to create custom tools for your agents. Use this when:
- You need to give agents specific capabilities (like web search, data analysis)
- You want to encapsulate external API calls or complex operations
- You need to share functionality across multiple agents

```python
@tool
def web_search_tool(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> list[str]:
    """
    Search the web for information.

    Args:
        query: The search query
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return

    Returns:
        List of search results
    """
    # Implement your search logic here
    return [f"Result {i} for: {query}" for i in range(max_results)]
```

#### @before_kickoff
Used to execute logic before the crew starts. Use this when:
- You need to validate or preprocess input data
- You want to set up resources or configurations before execution
- You need to perform any initialization logic

```python
@before_kickoff
def validate_inputs(self, inputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Validate and preprocess inputs before the crew starts."""
    if inputs is None:
        return None
        
    if 'topic' not in inputs:
        raise ValueError("Topic is required")
    
    # Add additional context
    inputs['timestamp'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    inputs['topic'] = inputs['topic'].strip().lower()
    return inputs
```

#### @after_kickoff
Used to process results after the crew completes. Use this when:
- You need to format or transform the final output
- You want to perform cleanup operations
- You need to save or log the results in a specific way

```python
@after_kickoff
def process_results(self, result: CrewOutput) -> CrewOutput:
    """Process and format the results after the crew completes."""
    result.raw = result.raw.strip()
    result.raw = f"""
    # Research Results
    Generated on: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
    
    {result.raw}
    """
    return result
```

#### @callback
Used to handle events during crew execution. Use this when:
- You need to monitor task progress
- You want to log intermediate results
- You need to implement custom progress tracking or metrics

```python
@callback
def log_task_completion(self, task: Task, output: str):
    """Log task completion details for monitoring."""
    print(f"Task '{task.description}' completed")
    print(f"Output length: {len(output)} characters")
    print(f"Agent used: {task.agent.role}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

#### @cache_handler
Used to implement custom caching for task results. Use this when:
- You want to avoid redundant expensive operations
- You need to implement custom cache storage or expiration logic
- You want to persist results between runs

```python
@cache_handler
def custom_cache(self, key: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Custom cache implementation for storing task results."""
    cache_file = f"cache/{key}.json"
    
    if os.path.exists(cache_file):
        with open(cache_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            # Check if cache is still valid (e.g., not expired)
            if datetime.fromisoformat(data['timestamp']) > datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1):
                return data['result']
    return None
```

<Note>
These decorators are part of the CrewAI framework and help organize your crew's structure by automatically collecting agents, tasks, and handling various lifecycle events. 
They should be used within a class decorated with `@CrewBase`.
</Note>

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memories --all
```

This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.
