# Setup API keys
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
  name="Intermediate Answer",
  func=search.run,
  description="Useful for search-based queries",
)

agent = Agent(
  role='Research Analyst',
