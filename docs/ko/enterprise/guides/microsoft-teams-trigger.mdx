## Overview

Use the Microsoft Teams trigger to start automations whenever a new chat is created. Common patterns include summarizing inbound requests, routing urgent messages to support teams, or creating follow-up tasks in other systems.

<Tip>
  Confirm Microsoft Teams is connected under **Tools & Integrations** and enabled in the **Triggers** tab for your deployment.

## Enabling the Microsoft Teams Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Microsoft Teams** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize a new chat thread

```python
from teams_chat_created_crew import MicrosoftTeamsChatTrigger

crew = MicrosoftTeamsChatTrigger().crew()
result = crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": teams_payload,
})
print(result.raw)
```

The crew parses thread metadata (subject, created time, roster) and generates an action plan for the receiving team.

## Sample payloads & crews

The [Microsoft Teams examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/microsoft-teams) include:

- `chat-created.json` → chat creation payload processed by `teams-chat-created-crew.py`

The crew demonstrates how to extract participants, initial messages, tenant information, and compliance metadata from the Microsoft Graph webhook payload.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Teams connection is active; it must be refreshed if the tenant revokes permissions
- Confirm the webhook subscription in Microsoft 365 is still valid if payloads stop arriving
- Review execution logs for payload shape mismatches—Graph notifications may omit fields when a chat is private or restricted
