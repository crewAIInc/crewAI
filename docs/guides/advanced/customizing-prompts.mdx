## Why Customize Prompts?

Although CrewAI's default prompts work well for many scenarios, low-level customization opens the door to significantly more flexible and powerful agent behavior. Here's why you might want to take advantage of this deeper control:

1. **Optimize for specific LLMs** – Different models (such as GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) thrive with prompt formats tailored to their unique architectures.
2. **Change the language** – Build agents that operate exclusively in languages beyond English, handling nuances with precision.
3. **Specialize for complex domains** – Adapt prompts for highly specialized industries like healthcare, finance, or legal.
4. **Adjust tone and style** – Make agents more formal, casual, creative, or analytical.
5. **Support super custom use cases** – Utilize advanced prompt structures and formatting to meet intricate, project-specific requirements.

This guide explores how to tap into CrewAI's prompts at a lower level, giving you fine-grained control over how agents think and interact.

## Understanding CrewAI's Prompt System

Under the hood, CrewAI employs a modular prompt system that you can customize extensively:

- **Agent templates** – Govern each agent's approach to their assigned role.
- **Prompt slices** – Control specialized behaviors such as tasks, tool usage, and output structure.
- **Error handling** – Direct how agents respond to failures, exceptions, or timeouts.
- **Tool-specific prompts** – Define detailed instructions for how tools are invoked or utilized.

Check out the [original prompt templates in CrewAI's repository](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/translations/en.json) to see how these elements are organized. From there, you can override or adapt them as needed to unlock advanced behaviors.

## Understanding Default System Instructions

<Warning>
**Production Transparency Issue**: CrewAI automatically injects default instructions into your prompts that you might not be aware of. This section explains what's happening under the hood and how to gain full control.
</Warning>

When you define an agent with `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`, CrewAI automatically adds additional system instructions that control formatting and behavior. Understanding these default injections is crucial for production systems where you need full prompt transparency.

### What CrewAI Automatically Injects

Based on your agent configuration, CrewAI adds different default instructions:

#### For Agents Without Tools
```text
"I MUST use these formats, my job depends on it!"
```

#### For Agents With Tools  
```text
"IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [tool_names]
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object...
```

#### For Structured Outputs (JSON/Pydantic)
```text
"Ensure your final answer contains only the content in the following format: {output_format}
Ensure the final output does not include any code block markers like ```json or ```python."
```

### Viewing the Complete System Prompt

To see exactly what prompt is being sent to your LLM, you can inspect the generated prompt:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.utilities.prompts import Prompts

# Create your agent
agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights",
    backstory="You are an expert data analyst with 10 years of experience.",
    verbose=True
)

# Create a sample task
task = Task(
    description="Analyze the sales data and identify trends",
    expected_output="A detailed analysis with key insights and trends",
    agent=agent
)

# Create the prompt generator
prompt_generator = Prompts(
    agent=agent,
    has_tools=len(agent.tools) > 0,
    use_system_prompt=agent.use_system_prompt
)

# Generate and inspect the actual prompt
generated_prompt = prompt_generator.task_execution()

# Print the complete system prompt that will be sent to the LLM
if "system" in generated_prompt:
    print("=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["system"])
    print("\n=== USER PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["user"])
else:
    print("=== COMPLETE PROMPT ===")
    print(generated_prompt["prompt"])

# You can also see how the task description gets formatted
print("\n=== TASK CONTEXT ===")
print(f"Task Description: {task.description}")
print(f"Expected Output: {task.expected_output}")
```

### Overriding Default Instructions

You have several options to gain full control over the prompts:

#### Option 1: Custom Templates (Recommended)
```python
from crewai import Agent

# Define your own system template without default instructions
custom_system_template = """You are {role}. {backstory}
Your goal is: {goal}

Respond naturally and conversationally. Focus on providing helpful, accurate information."""

custom_prompt_template = """Task: {input}

Please complete this task thoughtfully."""

agent = Agent(
    role="Research Assistant", 
    goal="Help users find accurate information",
    backstory="You are a helpful research assistant.",
    system_template=custom_system_template,
    prompt_template=custom_prompt_template,
    use_system_prompt=True  # Use separate system/user messages
)
```

#### Option 2: Custom Prompt File
Create a `custom_prompts.json` file to override specific prompt slices:

```json
{
  "slices": {
    "no_tools": "\nProvide your best answer in a natural, conversational way.",
    "tools": "\nYou have access to these tools: {tools}\n\nUse them when helpful, but respond naturally.",
    "formatted_task_instructions": "Format your response as: {output_format}"
  }
}
```

Then use it in your crew:

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    prompt_file="custom_prompts.json",
    verbose=True
)
```

#### Option 3: Disable System Prompts for o1 Models
```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data", 
    backstory="Expert analyst",
    use_system_prompt=False  # Disables system prompt separation
)
```

### Debugging with Observability Tools

For production transparency, integrate with observability platforms to see all prompts:

```python
# Using Langfuse for prompt visibility
import os
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task

# Set up Langfuse (see Langfuse integration docs)
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-key"
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret"

# Your crew will now trace all prompts to Langfuse
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

# All prompts, including default instructions, will be visible in Langfuse dashboard
result = crew.kickoff()
```

### Best Practices for Production

1. **Always inspect generated prompts** before deploying to production
2. **Use custom templates** when you need full control over prompt content
3. **Integrate observability tools** like Langfuse or MLflow for ongoing prompt monitoring
4. **Test with different LLMs** as default instructions may work differently across models
5. **Document your prompt customizations** for team transparency

<Tip>
The default instructions exist to ensure consistent agent behavior, but they can interfere with domain-specific requirements. Use the customization options above to maintain full control over your agent's behavior in production systems.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Managing Prompt Files

When engaging in low-level prompt customization, follow these guidelines to keep things organized and maintainable:

1. **Keep files separate** – Store your customized prompts in dedicated JSON files outside your main codebase.
2. **Version control** – Track changes within your repository, ensuring clear documentation of prompt adjustments over time.
3. **Organize by model or language** – Use naming schemes like `prompts_llama.json` or `prompts_es.json` to quickly identify specialized configurations.
4. **Document changes** – Provide comments or maintain a README detailing the purpose and scope of your customizations.
5. **Minimize alterations** – Only override the specific slices you genuinely need to adjust, keeping default functionality intact for everything else.

## The Simplest Way to Customize Prompts

One straightforward approach is to create a JSON file for the prompts you want to override and then point your Crew at that file:

1. Craft a JSON file with your updated prompt slices.
2. Reference that file via the `prompt_file` parameter in your Crew.

CrewAI then merges your customizations with the defaults, so you don't have to redefine every prompt. Here's how:

### Example: Basic Prompt Customization

Create a `custom_prompts.json` file with the prompts you want to modify. Ensure you list all top-level prompts it should contain, not just your changes:

```json
{
  "slices": {
    "format": "When responding, follow this structure:\n\nTHOUGHTS: Your step-by-step thinking\nACTION: Any tool you're using\nRESULT: Your final answer or conclusion"
  }
}
```

Then integrate it like so:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process

# Create agents and tasks as normal
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find information on quantum computing",
    backstory="You are a quantum physics expert",
    verbose=True
)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research quantum computing applications",
    expected_output="A summary of practical applications",
    agent=researcher
)

# Create a crew with your custom prompt file
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    prompt_file="path/to/custom_prompts.json",
    verbose=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
```

With these few edits, you gain low-level control over how your agents communicate and solve tasks.

## Optimizing for Specific Models

Different models thrive on differently structured prompts. Making deeper adjustments can significantly boost performance by aligning your prompts with a model's nuances.

### Example: Llama 3.3 Prompting Template

For instance, when dealing with Meta's Llama 3.3, deeper-level customization may reflect the recommended structure described at:
https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1/#prompt-template

Here's an example to highlight how you might fine-tune an Agent to leverage Llama 3.3 in code:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from crewai_tools import DirectoryReadTool, FileReadTool

# Define templates for system, user (prompt), and assistant (response) messages
system_template = """<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>{{ .System }}<|eot_id|>"""
prompt_template = """<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>"""
response_template = """<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>"""

# Create an Agent using Llama-specific layouts
principal_engineer = Agent(
    role="Principal Engineer",
    goal="Oversee AI architecture and make high-level decisions",
    backstory="You are the lead engineer responsible for critical AI systems",
    verbose=True,
    llm="groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile",  # Using the Llama 3 model
    system_template=system_template,
    prompt_template=prompt_template,
    response_template=response_template,
    tools=[DirectoryReadTool(), FileReadTool()]
)

# Define a sample task
engineering_task = Task(
    description="Review AI implementation files for potential improvements",
    expected_output="A summary of key findings and recommendations",
    agent=principal_engineer
)

# Create a Crew for the task
llama_crew = Crew(
    agents=[principal_engineer],
    tasks=[engineering_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = llama_crew.kickoff()
print(result.raw)
```

Through this deeper configuration, you can exercise comprehensive, low-level control over your Llama-based workflows without needing a separate JSON file.
