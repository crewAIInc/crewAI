# Evaluating Use Cases for CrewAI

## Understanding the Decision Framework

When building AI applications with CrewAI, one of the most important decisions you'll make is choosing the right approach for your specific use case. Should you use a Crew? A Flow? A combination of both? This guide will help you evaluate your requirements and make informed architectural decisions.

At the heart of this decision is understanding the relationship between **complexity** and **precision** in your application:

## Choosing Between Crews and Flows

### When to Choose Crews

Crews are ideal when:

1. **You need collaborative intelligence** - Multiple agents with different specializations need to work together
2. **The problem requires emergent thinking** - The solution benefits from different perspectives and approaches
3. **The task is primarily creative or analytical** - The work involves research, content creation, or analysis
4. **You value adaptability over strict structure** - The workflow can benefit from agent autonomy
5. **The output format can be somewhat flexible** - Some variation in output structure is acceptable

```python
# Example: Research Crew for market analysis
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Market Research Specialist",
    goal="Find comprehensive market data on emerging technologies",
    backstory="You are an expert at discovering market trends and gathering data."
)

analyst = Agent(
    role="Market Analyst",
    goal="Analyze market data and identify key opportunities",
    backstory="You excel at interpreting market data and spotting valuable insights."
)

# Define their tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the current market landscape for AI-powered healthcare solutions",
    expected_output="Comprehensive market data including key players, market size, and growth trends",
    agent=researcher
)

analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the market data and identify the top 3 investment opportunities",
    expected_output="Analysis report with 3 recommended investment opportunities and rationale",
    agent=analyst,
    context=[research_task]
)

# Create the crew
market_analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)

# Run the crew
result = market_analysis_crew.kickoff()
```

### When to Choose Flows

Flows are ideal when:

1. **You need precise control over execution** - The workflow requires exact sequencing and state management
2. **The application has complex state requirements** - You need to maintain and transform state across multiple steps
3. **You need structured, predictable outputs** - The application requires consistent, formatted results
4. **The workflow involves conditional logic** - Different paths need to be taken based on intermediate results
5. **You need to combine AI with procedural code** - The solution requires both AI capabilities and traditional programming

```python
# Example: Customer Support Flow with structured processing
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict

# Define structured state
class SupportTicketState(BaseModel):
    ticket_id: str = ""
    customer_name: str = ""
    issue_description: str = ""
    category: str = ""
    priority: str = "medium"
    resolution: str = ""
    satisfaction_score: int = 0

class CustomerSupportFlow(Flow[SupportTicketState]):
    @start()
    def receive_ticket(self):
        # In a real app, this might come from an API
        self.state.ticket_id = "TKT-12345"
        self.state.customer_name = "Alex Johnson"
        self.state.issue_description = "Unable to access premium features after payment"
        return "Ticket received"

    @listen(receive_ticket)
    def categorize_ticket(self, _):
        # Use a direct LLM call for categorization
        from crewai import LLM
        llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")

        prompt = f"""
        Categorize the following customer support issue into one of these categories:
        - Billing
        - Account Access
        - Technical Issue
        - Feature Request
        - Other

        Issue: {self.state.issue_description}

        Return only the category name.
        """

        self.state.category = llm.call(prompt).strip()
        return self.state.category

    @router(categorize_ticket)
    def route_by_category(self, category):
        # Route to different handlers based on category
        return category.lower().replace(" ", "_")

    @listen("billing")
    def handle_billing_issue(self):
        # Handle billing-specific logic
        self.state.priority = "high"
        # More billing-specific processing...
        return "Billing issue handled"

    @listen("account_access")
    def handle_access_issue(self):
        # Handle access-specific logic
        self.state.priority = "high"
        # More access-specific processing...
        return "Access issue handled"

    # Additional category handlers...

    @listen("billing", "account_access", "technical_issue", "feature_request", "other")
    def resolve_ticket(self, resolution_info):
        # Final resolution step
        self.state.resolution = f"Issue resolved: {resolution_info}"
        return self.state.resolution

# Run the flow
support_flow = CustomerSupportFlow()
result = support_flow.kickoff()
```

### When to Combine Crews and Flows

The most sophisticated applications often benefit from combining Crews and Flows:

1. **Complex multi-stage processes** - Use Flows to orchestrate the overall process and Crews for complex subtasks
2. **Applications requiring both creativity and structure** - Use Crews for creative tasks and Flows for structured processing
3. **Enterprise-grade AI applications** - Use Flows to manage state and process flow while leveraging Crews for specialized work

```python
