# DOCXSearchTool

!!! note "Depend on OpenAI"
    All RAG tools at the moment can only use openAI to generate embeddings, we are working on adding support for other providers.

!!! note "Experimental"
    We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.

## Description
The DOCXSearchTool is a RAG tool designed for semantic searching within DOCX documents. It enables users to effectively search and extract relevant information from DOCX files using query-based searches. This tool is invaluable for data analysis, information management, and research tasks, streamlining the process of finding specific information within large document collections.

## Installation
Install the crewai_tools package by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example
The following example demonstrates initializing the DOCXSearchTool to search within any DOCX file's content or with a specific DOCX file path.

```python
from crewai_tools import DOCXSearchTool

# Initialize the tool to search within any DOCX file's content
tool = DOCXSearchTool()

# OR

# Initialize the tool with a specific DOCX file, so the agent can only search the content of the specified DOCX file
tool = DOCXSearchTool(docx='path/to/your/document.docx')
```

## Arguments
- `docx`: An optional file path to a specific DOCX document you wish to search. If not provided during initialization, the tool allows for later specification of any DOCX file's content path for searching.
