!!! note "Depend on OpenAI"
    All RAG tools at the moment can only use openAI to generate embeddings, we are working on adding support for other providers.

!!! note "Experimental"
    We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.

## Description

```

## Example
```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

# To enable scrapping any website it finds during it's execution
tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()

# Initialize the tool with the website URL, so the agent can only scrap the content of the specified website
tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(website_url='https://www.example.com')
```
