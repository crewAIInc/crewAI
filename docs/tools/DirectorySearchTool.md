# DirectorySearchTool

!!! note "Depend on OpenAI"
    All RAG tools at the moment can only use openAI to generate embeddings, we are working on adding support for other providers.

!!! note "Experimental"
    We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.

## Description
This tool is designed to perform a semantic search for queries within the content of a specified directory. Utilizing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) methodology, it offers a powerful means to semantically navigate through the files of a given directory. The tool can be dynamically set to search any directory specified at runtime or can be pre-configured to search within a specific directory upon initialization.

## Installation
To start using the DirectorySearchTool, you need to install the crewai_tools package. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example
The following examples demonstrate how to initialize the DirectorySearchTool for different use cases and how to perform a search:

```python
from crewai_tools import DirectorySearchTool

# To enable searching within any specified directory at runtime
tool = DirectorySearchTool()

# Alternatively, to restrict searches to a specific directory
tool = DirectorySearchTool(directory='/path/to/directory')
```

## Arguments
- `directory` : This string argument specifies the directory within which to search. It is mandatory if the tool has not been initialized with a directory; otherwise, the tool will only search within the initialized directory.
