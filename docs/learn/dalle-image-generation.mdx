CrewAI supports integration with OpenAI's DALL-E, allowing your AI agents to generate images as part of their tasks. This guide will walk you through how to set up and use the DALL-E tool in your CrewAI projects.

## Prerequisites

- crewAI installed (latest version)
- OpenAI API key with access to DALL-E

## Setting Up the DALL-E Tool

<Steps>
    <Step title="Import the DALL-E tool">
        ```python
        from crewai_tools import DallETool
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the DALL-E tool to your agent configuration">
        ```python
        @agent
        def researcher(self) -> Agent:
            return Agent(
                config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
                tools=[SerperDevTool(), DallETool()],  # Add DallETool to the list of tools
                allow_delegation=False,
                verbose=True
            )
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the DALL-E Tool

Once you've added the DALL-E tool to your agent, it can generate images based on text prompts. The tool will return a URL to the generated image, which can be used in the agent's output or passed to other agents for further processing.

### Example Agent Configuration

```yaml
role: >
    LinkedIn Profile Senior Data Researcher
goal: >
    Uncover detailed LinkedIn profiles based on provided name {name} and domain {domain}
    Generate a Dall-e image based on domain {domain}
backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the most relevant LinkedIn profiles.
    Known for your ability to navigate LinkedIn efficiently, you excel at gathering and presenting
    professional information clearly and concisely.
```

### Expected Output

The agent with the DALL-E tool will be able to generate the image and provide a URL in its response. You can then download the image.

    <img src="/images/enterprise/dall-e-image.png" alt="DALL-E Image" />
</Frame>

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific in your image generation prompts** to get the best results.
2. **Consider generation time** - Image generation can take some time, so factor this into your task planning.
3. **Follow usage policies** - Always comply with OpenAI's usage policies when generating images.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check API access** - Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to DALL-E.
2. **Version compatibility** - Check that you're using the latest version of crewAI and crewai-tools.
3. **Tool configuration** - Verify that the DALL-E tool is correctly added to the agent's tool list.
