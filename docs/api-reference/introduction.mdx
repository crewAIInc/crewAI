# CrewAI Enterprise API

Welcome to the CrewAI Enterprise API reference. This API allows you to programmatically interact with your deployed crews, enabling integration with your applications, workflows, and services.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Credentials">
    Navigate to your crew's detail page in the CrewAI Enterprise dashboard and copy your Bearer Token from the Status tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Discover Required Inputs">
    Use the `GET /inputs` endpoint to see what parameters your crew expects.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start a Crew Execution">
    Call `POST /kickoff` with your inputs to start the crew execution and receive a `kickoff_id`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Use `GET /status/{kickoff_id}` to check execution status and retrieve results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. Include your token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" \
  https://your-crew-url.crewai.com/inputs
```

### Token Types

| Token Type | Scope | Use Case |
|:-----------|:--------|:----------|
| **Bearer Token** | Organization-level access | Full crew operations, ideal for server-to-server integration |
| **User Bearer Token** | User-scoped access | Limited permissions, suitable for user-specific operations |

<Tip>
You can find both token types in the Status tab of your crew's detail page in the CrewAI Enterprise dashboard.
</Tip>

## Base URL

Each deployed crew has its own unique API endpoint:

```
https://your-crew-name.crewai.com
```

Replace `your-crew-name` with your actual crew's URL from the dashboard.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Call `GET /inputs` to understand what your crew needs
2. **Execution**: Submit inputs via `POST /kickoff` to start processing  
3. **Monitoring**: Poll `GET /status/{kickoff_id}` until completion
4. **Results**: Extract the final output from the completed response

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|:--------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid input format |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid bearer token |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `422` | Validation Error - Missing required inputs |
| `500` | Server Error - Contact support |

## Interactive Testing

<Info>
**Why no "Send" button?** Since each CrewAI Enterprise user has their own unique crew URL, we use **reference mode** instead of an interactive playground to avoid confusion. This shows you exactly what the requests should look like without non-functional send buttons.
</Info>

Each endpoint page shows you:
- ✅ **Exact request format** with all parameters
- ✅ **Response examples** for success and error cases  
- ✅ **Code samples** in multiple languages (cURL, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- ✅ **Authentication examples** with proper Bearer token format

### **To Test Your Actual API:**

  <Card title="Copy cURL Examples" icon="terminal">
    Copy the cURL examples and replace the URL + token with your real values
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Postman/Insomnia" icon="play">
    Import the examples into your preferred API testing tool
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example workflow:**
1. **Copy this cURL example** from any endpoint page
2. **Replace `your-actual-crew-name.crewai.com`** with your real crew URL  
3. **Replace the Bearer token** with your real token from the dashboard
4. **Run the request** in your terminal or API client
