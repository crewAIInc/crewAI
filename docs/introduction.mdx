# What is CrewAI?

**CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.** 

CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks.

Think of it as assembling your dream team - each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives.

## How CrewAI Works

<Note>
  Just like a company has departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) working together under leadership to achieve business goals, CrewAI helps you create an organization of AI agents with specialized roles collaborating to accomplish complex tasks.
