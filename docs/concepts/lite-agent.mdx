## Overview

A `LiteAgent` is a streamlined version of CrewAI's Agent, designed for simpler, standalone tasks that don't require the full complexity of a crew-based workflow. It's perfect for quick automations, single-purpose tasks, or when you need a lightweight solution.

<Tip>
  Think of a LiteAgent as a specialized worker that excels at individual tasks.
  While regular Agents are team players in a crew, LiteAgents are solo
  performers optimized for specific operations.

## Creating a LiteAgent

Here's a simple example of creating and using a standalone LiteAgent:

```python
from typing import List, cast

from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from crewai.lite_agent import LiteAgent


# Define a structured output format
class MovieReview(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="The title of the movie")
    rating: float = Field(description="Rating out of 10")
    pros: List[str] = Field(description="List of positive aspects")
    cons: List[str] = Field(description="List of negative aspects")


# Create a LiteAgent
critic = LiteAgent(
    role="Movie Critic",
    goal="Provide insightful movie reviews",
    backstory="You are an experienced film critic known for balanced, thoughtful reviews.",
    tools=[SerperDevTool()],
    verbose=True,
    response_format=MovieReview,
)

# Use the agent
query = """
Review the movie 'Inception'. Include:
1. Your rating out of 10
2. Key positive aspects
3. Areas that could be improved
"""

result = critic.kickoff(query)


# Access the structured output
review = cast(MovieReview, result.pydantic)
print(f"\nMovie Review: {review.title}")
print(f"Rating: {review.rating}/10")
print("\nPros:")
for pro in review.pros:
    print(f"- {pro}")
print("\nCons:")
for con in review.cons:
    print(f"- {con}")

```

This example demonstrates the core features of a LiteAgent:

- Structured output using Pydantic models
- Tool integration with WebSearchTool
- Simple execution with `kickoff()`
- Easy access to both raw and structured results

## Using LiteAgent in a Flow

For more complex scenarios, you can integrate LiteAgents into a Flow. Here's an example of a market research flow:

````python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, start, listen
from crewai.lite_agent import LiteAgent
from crewai.tools import WebSearchTool

# Define a structured output format
class MarketAnalysis(BaseModel):
    key_trends: List[str] = Field(description="List of identified market trends")
    market_size: str = Field(description="Estimated market size")
    competitors: List[str] = Field(description="Major competitors in the space")

# Define flow state
class MarketResearchState(BaseModel):
    product: str = ""
    analysis: MarketAnalysis = None

# Create a flow class
class MarketResearchFlow(Flow[MarketResearchState]):
    @start()
    def initialize_research(self, product: str):
        print(f"Starting market research for {product}")
        self.state.product = product

    @listen(initialize_research)
    async def analyze_market(self):
        # Create a LiteAgent for market research
        analyst = LiteAgent(
            role="Market Research Analyst",
            goal=f"Analyze the market for {self.state.product}",
            backstory="You are an experienced market analyst with expertise in "
                     "identifying market trends and opportunities.",
            tools=[WebSearchTool()],
            verbose=True,
            response_format=MarketAnalysis
        )

        # Define the research query
        query = f"""
        Research the market for {self.state.product}. Include:
        1. Key market trends
        2. Market size
        3. Major competitors

        Format your response according to the specified structure.
        """

        # Execute the analysis
        result = await analyst.kickoff_async(query)
        self.state.analysis = result.pydantic
        return result.pydantic

    @listen(analyze_market)
    def present_results(self):
        analysis = self.state.analysis
        print("\nMarket Analysis Results")
        print("=====================")

        print("\nKey Market Trends:")
        for trend in analysis.key_trends:
            print(f"- {trend}")

        print(f"\nMarket Size: {analysis.market_size}")

        print("\nMajor Competitors:")
        for competitor in analysis.competitors:
            print(f"- {competitor}")

# Usage example
import asyncio

async def run_flow():
    flow = MarketResearchFlow()
    result = await flow.kickoff(inputs={"product": "AI-powered chatbots"})
    return result

# Run the flow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_flow())

## Key Features

### 1. Simplified Setup
Unlike regular Agents, LiteAgents are designed for quick setup and standalone operation. They don't require crew configuration or task management.

### 2. Structured Output
LiteAgents support Pydantic models for response formatting, making it easy to get structured, type-safe data from your agent's operations.

### 3. Tool Integration
Just like regular Agents, LiteAgents can use tools to enhance their capabilities:
```python
from crewai.tools import SerperDevTool, CalculatorTool

agent = LiteAgent(
    role="Research Assistant",
    goal="Find and analyze information",
    tools=[SerperDevTool(), CalculatorTool()],
    verbose=True
)
````

### 4. Async Support

LiteAgents support asynchronous execution through the `kickoff_async` method, making them suitable for non-blocking operations in your application.

## Response Formatting

LiteAgents support structured output through Pydantic models using the `response_format` parameter. This feature ensures type safety and consistent output structure, making it easier to work with agent responses in your application.

### Basic Usage

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SearchResult(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="The title of the found content")
    summary: str = Field(description="A brief summary of the content")
    relevance_score: float = Field(description="Relevance score from 0 to 1")

agent = LiteAgent(
    role="Search Specialist",
    goal="Find and summarize relevant information",
    response_format=SearchResult
)

result = await agent.kickoff_async("Find information about quantum computing")
print(f"Title: {result.pydantic.title}")
print(f"Summary: {result.pydantic.summary}")
print(f"Relevance: {result.pydantic.relevance_score}")
```

### Handling Responses

When using `response_format`, the agent's response will be available in two forms:

1. **Raw Response**: Access the unstructured string response

   ```python
   result = await agent.kickoff_async("Analyze the market")
   print(result.raw)  # Original LLM response
   ```

2. **Structured Response**: Access the parsed Pydantic model
   ```python
   print(result.pydantic)  # Parsed response as Pydantic model
   print(result.pydantic.dict())  # Convert to dictionary
   ```
