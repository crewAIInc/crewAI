## Using LangChain Tools

<Info>
    CrewAI seamlessly integrates with LangChain’s comprehensive [list of tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/), all of which can be used with CrewAI.
</Info>

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper

# Setup API keys
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
  name="Intermediate Answer",
  func=search.run,
  description="Useful for search-based queries",
)

agent = Agent(
  role='Research Analyst',
  goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
  backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
  tools=[serper_tool]
)

# rest of the code ...
```

## Conclusion

Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively.
