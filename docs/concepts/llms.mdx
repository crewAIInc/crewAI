<Note>
  CrewAI integrates with multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM, giving you the flexibility to choose the right model for your specific use case. This guide will help you understand how to configure and use different LLM providers in your CrewAI projects.
</Note>

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core intelligence behind CrewAI agents. They enable agents to understand context, make decisions, and generate human-like responses. Here's what you need to know:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="LLM Basics" icon="brain">
    Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They power the intelligence of your CrewAI agents, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Window" icon="window">
    The context window determines how much text an LLM can process at once. Larger windows (e.g., 128K tokens) allow for more context but may be more expensive and slower.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Temperature" icon="temperature-three-quarters">
    Temperature (0.0 to 1.0) controls response randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase creativity and variability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider Selection" icon="server">
    Each LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) offers different models with varying capabilities, pricing, and features. Choose based on your needs for accuracy, speed, and cost.

## Setting Up Your LLM

There are three ways to configure LLMs in CrewAI. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Environment Variables">
    The simplest way to get started. Set these variables in your environment:

    ```bash
    # Required: Your API key for authentication
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

    # Optional: Default model selection
    OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini  # Default if not set

    # Optional: Organization ID (if applicable)
    OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=<your-org-id>
    ```

    <Warning>
      Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment files (.env) or your system's secret management.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="2. YAML Configuration">
    Create a YAML file to define your agent configurations. This method is great for version control and team collaboration:

## Advanced Features and Optimization

Learn how to get the most out of your LLM configuration:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Window Management">
    CrewAI includes smart context management features:

    ```python
    from crewai import LLM

    # CrewAI automatically handles:
    # 1. Token counting and tracking
    # 2. Content summarization when needed
    # 3. Task splitting for large contexts

    llm = LLM(
        model="gpt-4",
        max_tokens=4000,  # Limit response length
    )
    ```

    <Info>
      Best practices for context management:
      1. Choose models with appropriate context windows
      2. Pre-process long inputs when possible
      3. Use chunking for large documents
      4. Monitor token usage to optimize costs
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Token Usage Optimization">
        Choose the right context window for your task:
        - Small tasks (up to 4K tokens): Standard models
        - Medium tasks (between 4K-32K): Enhanced models
        - Large tasks (over 32K): Large context models
        
        ```python
        # Configure model with appropriate settings
        llm = LLM(
            model="openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview",
            temperature=0.7,    # Adjust based on task
            max_tokens=4096,    # Set based on output needs
            timeout=300        # Longer timeout for complex tasks
        )
        ```
        <Tip>
          - Lower temperature (0.1 to 0.3) for factual responses
          - Higher temperature (0.7 to 0.9) for creative tasks
        </Tip>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Best Practices">
        1. Monitor token usage
        2. Implement rate limiting
        3. Use caching when possible
        4. Set appropriate max_tokens limits
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      Remember to regularly monitor your token usage and adjust your configuration as needed to optimize costs and performance.

## Common Issues and Solutions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Authentication">
    <Warning>
      Most authentication issues can be resolved by checking API key format and environment variable names.
    </Warning>
    
    ```bash
    # OpenAI
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    
    # Anthropic
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Model Names">
    <Check>
      Always include the provider prefix in model names
    </Check>
    
    ```python
    # Correct
    llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4")
    
    # Incorrect
    llm = LLM(model="gpt-4")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Context Length">
    <Tip>
      Use larger context models for extensive tasks
    </Tip>
    
    ```python
    # Large context model
    llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4o")  # 128K tokens

<Note>
  Best Practices for API Key Security:
  - Use environment variables or secure vaults
  - Never commit keys to version control
  - Rotate keys regularly
  - Use separate keys for development and production
  - Monitor key usage for unusual patterns
