### 9. API Keys

When running ```crewai create crew``` command, the CLI will first show you the top 5 most common LLM providers and ask you to select one.

Once you've selected an LLM provider, you will be prompted for API keys.

#### Initial API key providers

The CLI will initially prompt for API keys for the following services:

* OpenAI
* Groq
* Anthropic
* Google Gemini

When you select a provider, the CLI will prompt you to enter your API key.

#### Other Options

If you select option 6, you will be able to select from a list of LiteLLM supported providers.

When you select a provider, the CLI will prompt you to enter the Key name and the API key.

See the following link for each provider's key name:
