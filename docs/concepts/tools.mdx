## Introduction
CrewAI tools empower agents with capabilities ranging from web searching and data analysis to collaboration and delegating tasks among coworkers. 
This documentation outlines how to create, integrate, and leverage these tools within the CrewAI framework, including a new focus on collaboration tools.

## What is a Tool?

A tool in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions. 
This includes tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools), 
enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.

## Key Characteristics of Tools

- **Utility**: Crafted for tasks such as web searching, data analysis, content generation, and agent collaboration.
- **Integration**: Boosts agent capabilities by seamlessly integrating tools into their workflow.
- **Customizability**: Provides the flexibility to develop custom tools or utilize existing ones, catering to the specific needs of agents.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Features intelligent caching to optimize performance and reduce redundant operations.

## Using CrewAI Tools

To enhance your agents' capabilities with crewAI tools, begin by installing our extra tools package:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Here's an example demonstrating their use:

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
# Importing crewAI tools
from crewai_tools import (
    DirectoryReadTool,
    FileReadTool,
    SerperDevTool,
    WebsiteSearchTool
)

# Set up API keys
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Instantiate tools
docs_tool = DirectoryReadTool(directory='./blog-posts')
file_tool = FileReadTool()
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
web_rag_tool = WebsiteSearchTool()

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Market Research Analyst',
    goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis of the AI industry',
    backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
    tools=[search_tool, web_rag_tool],
    verbose=True
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Content Writer',
    goal='Craft engaging blog posts about the AI industry',
    backstory='A skilled writer with a passion for technology.',
    tools=[docs_tool, file_tool],
    verbose=True
)

# Define tasks
research = Task(
    description='Research the latest trends in the AI industry and provide a summary.',
    expected_output='A summary of the top 3 trending developments in the AI industry with a unique perspective on their significance.',
    agent=researcher
)

write = Task(
    description='Write an engaging blog post about the AI industry, based on the research analyst’s summary. Draw inspiration from the latest blog posts in the directory.',
    expected_output='A 4-paragraph blog post formatted in markdown with engaging, informative, and accessible content, avoiding complex jargon.',
    agent=writer,
    output_file='blog-posts/new_post.md'  # The final blog post will be saved here
)

# Assemble a crew with planning enabled
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research, write],
    verbose=True,
    planning=True,  # Enable planning feature
)

# Execute tasks
crew.kickoff()
```

## Available CrewAI Tools

- **Error Handling**: All tools are built with error handling capabilities, allowing agents to gracefully manage exceptions and continue their tasks.
- **Caching Mechanism**: All tools support caching, enabling agents to efficiently reuse previously obtained results, reducing the load on external resources and speeding up the execution time. You can also define finer control over the caching mechanism using the `cache_function` attribute on the tool.

Here is a list of the available tools and their descriptions:

## Creating your own Tools

<Tip>
  Developers can craft `custom tools` tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options.
</Tip>

To create your own CrewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a CrewAI tool:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

```python Code
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

### Utilizing the `tool` Decorator

```python Code
from crewai_tools import tool
@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

### Custom Caching Mechanism

<Tip>
  Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.
</Tip>

```python Code
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

writer1 = Agent(
        role="Writer",
        goal="You write lessons of math for kids.",
        backstory="You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math.",
        tools=[multiplication_tool],
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
    #...
```

## Conclusion

Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. 
When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling, 
caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.
