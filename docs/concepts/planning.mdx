## Introduction

The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration, 
all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature

Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add `planning=True` to your Crew:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

#### Planning LLM

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks. You can use any ChatOpenAI LLM model available.

When running the base case example, you will see something like the output below, which represents the output of the `AgentPlanner` 
responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agents' tasks.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
    planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
)

# Run the crew
my_crew.kickoff()
```

**Step-by-Step Plan for Task Execution**

**Task Number 1: Conduct a thorough research about AI LLMs**

**Agent:** AI LLMs Senior Data Researcher

**Agent Goal:** Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI LLMs

**Task Expected Output:** A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI LLMs

**Task Tools:** None specified

**Agent Tools:** None specified

**Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Define Research Scope:**

   - Determine the specific areas of AI LLMs to focus on, such as advancements in architecture, use cases, ethical considerations, and performance metrics.

2. **Identify Reliable Sources:**

   - List reputable sources for AI research, including academic journals, industry reports, conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ACL), AI research labs (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI), and online databases (e.g., IEEE Xplore, arXiv).

3. **Collect Data:**

   - Search for the latest papers, articles, and reports published in 2023 and early 2024.
   - Use keywords like "Large Language Models 2024", "AI LLM advancements", "AI ethics 2024", etc.

4. **Analyze Findings:**

   - Read and summarize the key points from each source.
   - Highlight new techniques, models, and applications introduced in the past year.

5. **Organize Information:**

   - Categorize the information into relevant topics (e.g., new architectures, ethical implications, real-world applications).
   - Ensure each bullet point is concise but informative.

6. **Create the List:**

   - Compile the 10 most relevant pieces of information into a bullet point list.
   - Review the list to ensure clarity and relevance.

**Expected Output:**

A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI LLMs.

**Task Number 2: Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report**

**Agent:** AI LLMs Reporting Analyst

**Agent Goal:** Create detailed reports based on AI LLMs data analysis and research findings

**Task Expected Output:** A fully fledged report with the main topics, each with a full section of information. Formatted as markdown without '```'

**Task Tools:** None specified

**Agent Tools:** None specified

**Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Review the Bullet Points:**
   - Carefully read through the list of 10 bullet points provided by the AI LLMs Senior Data Researcher.

2. **Outline the Report:**
   - Create an outline with each bullet point as a main section heading.
   - Plan sub-sections under each main heading to cover different aspects of the topic.

3. **Research Further Details:**
   - For each bullet point, conduct additional research if necessary to gather more detailed information.
   - Look for case studies, examples, and statistical data to support each section.

4. **Write Detailed Sections:**
   - Expand each bullet point into a comprehensive section.
   - Ensure each section includes an introduction, detailed explanation, examples, and a conclusion.
   - Use markdown formatting for headings, subheadings, lists, and emphasis.

5. **Review and Edit:**
   - Proofread the report for clarity, coherence, and correctness.
   - Make sure the report flows logically from one section to the next.
   - Format the report according to markdown standards.

6. **Finalize the Report:**
   - Ensure the report is complete with all sections expanded and detailed.
   - Double-check formatting and make any necessary adjustments.

**Expected Output:**
A fully fledged report with the main topics, each with a full section of information. Formatted as markdown without '```'.
