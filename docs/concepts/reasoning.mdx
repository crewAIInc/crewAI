# Agent Reasoning

Agent reasoning is a feature that allows agents to reflect on a task and create a plan before execution. This helps agents approach tasks more methodically and ensures they're ready to perform the assigned work.

## How to Use Agent Reasoning

To enable reasoning for an agent, simply set `reasoning=True` when creating the agent:

```python
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze complex datasets and provide insights",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with expertise in finding patterns in complex data.",
    reasoning=True,  # Enable reasoning
    max_reasoning_attempts=3  # Optional: Set a maximum number of reasoning attempts
)
```

## How It Works

When reasoning is enabled, before executing a task, the agent will:

1. Reflect on the task and create a detailed plan
2. Evaluate whether it's ready to execute the task
3. Refine the plan as necessary until it's ready or max_reasoning_attempts is reached
4. Inject the reasoning plan into the task description before execution

This process helps the agent break down complex tasks into manageable steps and identify potential challenges before starting.

## Configuration Options

- `reasoning` (bool): Enable or disable reasoning (default: False)
- `max_reasoning_attempts` (int, optional): Maximum number of attempts to refine the plan before proceeding with execution. If None (default), the agent will continue refining until it's ready.

## Example

Here's a complete example:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent with reasoning enabled
analyst = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights",
    backstory="You are an expert data analyst.",
    reasoning=True,
    max_reasoning_attempts=3  # Optional: Set a limit on reasoning attempts
)

# Create a task
analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the provided sales data and identify key trends.",
    expected_output="A report highlighting the top 3 sales trends.",
    agent=analyst
)

# Create a crew and run the task
crew = Crew(agents=[analyst], tasks=[analysis_task])
result = crew.kickoff()

print(result)
```
