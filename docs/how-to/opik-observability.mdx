# Opik Overview

With [Comet Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/), debug, evaluate, and monitor your LLM applications, RAG systems, and agentic workflows with comprehensive tracing, automated evaluations, and production-ready dashboards.

Opik provides comprehensive support for every stage of your CrewAI application development:

- **Log Traces and Spans**: Automatically track LLM calls and application logic to debug and analyze development and production systems. Manually or programmatically annotate, view, and compare responses across projects.
- **Evaluate Your LLM Application's Performance**: Evaluate against a custom test set and run built-in evaluation metrics or define your own metrics in the SDK or UI.
- **Test Within Your CI/CD Pipeline**: Establish reliable performance baselines with Opik's LLM unit tests, built on PyTest. Run online evaluations for continuous monitoring in production.
- **Monitor & Analyze Production Data**: Understand your models' performance on unseen data in production and generate datasets for new dev iterations.

## Setup
Comet provides a hosted version of the Opik platform, or you can run the platform locally. 

To use the hosted version, simply [create a Comet account](https://www.comet.com/signup?utm_medium=github&utm_source=crewai_docs) and grab you API Key.

To run the Opik platform locally, see our [installation guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/overview/) for more information.

For this guide we will use CrewAI’s quickstart example.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install required packages">
      ```shell
      %pip install crewai crewai-tools opik --upgrade
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Opik">
      ```python
      import opik
      opik.configure(use_local=False)
      ```
    <Step title="Prepare environment">
      First, we set up our API keys for our LLM-provider as environment variables:
      ```python
      import os
      import getpass

      if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
      os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Using CrewAI">
      The first step is to create our project. We will use an example from CrewAI’s documentation:
      ```python
      from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process


class YourCrewName:
    def agent_one(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            role="Data Analyst",
            goal="Analyze data trends in the market",
            backstory="An experienced data analyst with a background in economics",
            verbose=True,
        )

    def agent_two(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            role="Market Researcher",
            goal="Gather information on market dynamics",
            backstory="A diligent researcher with a keen eye for detail",
            verbose=True,
        )

    def task_one(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            name="Collect Data Task",
            description="Collect recent market data and identify trends.",
            expected_output="A report summarizing key trends in the market.",
            agent=self.agent_one(),
        )

    def task_two(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            name="Market Research Task",
            description="Research factors affecting market dynamics.",
            expected_output="An analysis of factors influencing the market.",
            agent=self.agent_two(),
        )

    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=[self.agent_one(), self.agent_two()],
            tasks=[self.task_one(), self.task_two()],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )

      ```
      Now we can import Opik’s tracker and run our crew:
      ```python
      from opik.integrations.crewai import track_crewai

      track_crewai(project_name="crewai-integration-demo")

      my_crew = YourCrewName().crew()
      result = my_crew.kickoff()

      print(result)
      ```
      After running your CrewAI application, visit the Opik app to view:
      - LLM traces, spans, and their metadata
      - Agent interactions and task execution flow
      - Performance metrics like latency and token usage
      - Evaluation metrics (built-in or custom)
