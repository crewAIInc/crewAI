# MLflow Overview

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform to assist machine learning practitioners and teams in handling the complexities of the machine learning process.

It provides a tracing feature that enhances LLM observability in your Generative AI applications by capturing detailed information about the execution of your applicationâ€™s services. 
Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

### Features

- **Tracing Dashboard**: Monitor activities of your crewAI agents with detailed dashboards that include inputs, outputs and metadata of spans.
- **Automated Tracing**: A fully automated integration with crewAI, which can be enabled by running `mlflow.crewai.autolog()`. 
- **Manual Trace Instrumentation with minor efforts**: Customize trace instrumentation through MLflow's high-level fluent APIs such as decorators, function wrappers and context managers.
- **OpenTelemetry Compatibility**: MLflow Tracing supports exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which can then be used to export traces to various backends such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and AWS X-Ray.
- **Package and Deploy Agents**: Package and deploy your crewAI agents to an inference server with a variety of deployment targets.
- **Securely Host LLMs**: Host multiple LLM from various providers in one unified endpoint through MFflow gateway.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate your crewAI agents with a wide range of metrics using a convenient API `mlflow.evaluate()`.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install MLflow package">
      ```shell
      # The crewAI integration is available in mlflow>=2.19.0
      pip install mlflow
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start MFflow tracking server">
      ```shell
      # This process is optional, but it is recommended to use MLflow tracking server for better visualization and broader features.
      mlflow server
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize MLflow in Your Application">
      Add the following two lines to your application code:

      ```python
      import mlflow

      mlflow.crewai.autolog()

      # Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment name if you have a tracking server
      mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
      mlflow.set_experiment("CrewAI")
      ```
      
      Example Usage for tracing CrewAI Agents:

      ```python
      from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
      from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource
      from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool

      from textwrap import dedent

      content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
      string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
          content=content, metadata={"preference": "personal"}
      )

      search_tool = WebsiteSearchTool()


      class TripAgents:
