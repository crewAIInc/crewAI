  # CrewAI v0.1.0 Release Notes

  We are thrilled to announce the initial release of CrewAI, version 0.1.0! CrewAI is a framework designed to facilitate the orchestration of autonomous AI agents capable of role-playing and collaboration to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently.

  ## What's New

  - **Initial Launch**: CrewAI is now officially in the wild! This foundational release lays the groundwork for AI agents to work in tandem, each with its own specialized role and objectives.

  - **Role-Based Agent Design**: Define and customize agents with specific roles, goals, and the tools they need to succeed.

  - **Inter-Agent Delegation**: Agents are now equipped to autonomously delegate tasks, enabling dynamic distribution of workload among the team.

  - **Task Management**: Create and assign tasks dynamically with the flexibility to specify the tools needed for each task.

  - **Sequential Processes**: Set up your agents to tackle tasks one after the other, ensuring organized and predictable workflows.

  - **Documentation**: Start exploring CrewAI with our initial documentation that guides you through the setup and use of the framework.

  ## Enhancements

  - Detailed API documentation for the `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, and `Process` classes.
  - Examples and tutorials to help you build your first CrewAI application.
  - Basic setup for collaborative and delegation mechanisms among agents.

  ## Known Issues

  - As this is the first release, there may be undiscovered bugs and areas for optimization. We encourage the community to report any issues found during use.

  ## Upcoming Features

  - **Advanced Process Management**: In future releases, we will introduce more complex processes for task management including consensual and hierarchical workflows.
