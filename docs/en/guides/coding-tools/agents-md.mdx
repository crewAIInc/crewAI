## Why AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is a lightweight, repo-local instruction file that gives coding agents consistent, project-specific guidance. Keep it in the project root and treat it as the source of truth for how you want assistants to work: conventions, commands, architecture notes, and guardrails.

## Create a Project with the CLI

Use the CrewAI CLI to scaffold a project, then `AGENTS.md` will be automatically added at the root.

```bash
# Crew
crewai create crew my_crew

# Flow
crewai create flow my_flow

# Tool repository
crewai tool create my_tool
```

## Tool Setup: Point Assistants to AGENTS.md

### Codex

Codex can be guided by `AGENTS.md` files placed in your repository. Use them to supply persistent project context such as conventions, commands, and workflow expectations.

### Claude Code

Claude Code stores project memory in `CLAUDE.md`. You can bootstrap it with `/init` and edit it using `/memory`. Claude Code also supports imports inside `CLAUDE.md`, so you can add a single line like `@AGENTS.md` to pull in the shared instructions without duplicating them.

You can simply use:

```bash
mv AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

### Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity

Gemini CLI and Antigravity load a project context file (default: `GEMINI.md`) from the repo root and parent directories. You can configure it to read `AGENTS.md` instead (or in addition) by setting `context.fileName` in your Gemini CLI settings. For example, set it to `AGENTS.md` only, or include both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` if you want to keep each tool’s format.

You can simply use:

```bash
mv AGENTS.md GEMINI.md
```

### Cursor

Cursor supports `AGENTS.md` as a project instruction file. Place it at the project root to provide guidance for Cursor’s coding assistant.

### Windsurf

Claude Code provides an official integration with Windsurf. If you use Claude Code inside Windsurf, follow the Claude Code guidance above and import `AGENTS.md` from `CLAUDE.md`.

If you are using Windsurf’s native assistant, configure its project rules or instructions feature (if available) to read from `AGENTS.md` or paste the contents directly.
