## Agent: The 5 Key Attributes

An `Agent` is an autonomous unit with a role, a goal, and the tools to get things done.

| Attribute | Parameter | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | `role` | Defines the agent's function and expertise |
| **Goal** | `goal` | The individual objective guiding decisions |
| **Backstory** | `backstory` | Context and personality enriching interactions |
| **Tools** | `tools` | List of capabilities the agent can use (default: `[]`) |
| **LLM** | `llm` | The language model powering the agent (default: `gpt-4o`) |

### Minimal Agent Example

```python
from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Analyst",
    goal="Find accurate, up-to-date information on any topic",
    backstory="An expert at gathering data from multiple sources and identifying key insights.",
    tools=[],      # add tools here, e.g. SerperDevTool()
    verbose=True,  # enable logs for debugging
)
```

## Task: Description + Expected Output + Agent

A `Task` is a specific assignment given to an agent. Two fields are required; agent assignment is strongly recommended.

| Attribute | Parameter | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | `description` | What the agent must do |
| **Expected Output** | `expected_output` | What a successful completion looks like |
| **Agent** | `agent` | Which agent handles this task |
| **Context** | `context` | Other tasks whose outputs feed into this one |
| **Output File** | `output_file` | Save output to a file path |

### Minimal Task Example

```python
from crewai import Task

research_task = Task(
    description="Research the top 5 AI frameworks released in 2025 and summarize their key features.",
    expected_output="A markdown list of 5 frameworks with name, key feature, and one-sentence summary.",
    agent=researcher,
)
```

## Process Types: How Tasks Are Executed

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

# Sequential (default): tasks run in order, output feeds into the next
crew = Crew(agents=[...], tasks=[...], process=Process.sequential)

# Hierarchical: a manager LLM assigns tasks based on agent capabilities
crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm="gpt-4o",   # required for hierarchical
)
```

**Sequential** — use when tasks have a clear order and each builds on the previous.
**Hierarchical** — use when tasks should be dynamically assigned by a manager agent.
