## Overview

In the CrewAI framework, a `Task` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`.

Tasks provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.

Tasks within CrewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the Crew's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

<Note type="info" title="Enterprise Enhancement: Visual Task Builder">
CrewAI Enterprise includes a Visual Task Builder in Crew Studio that simplifies complex task creation and chaining. Design your task flows visually and test them in real-time without writing code.

The Visual Task Builder enables:
- Drag-and-drop task creation
- Visual task dependencies and flow
- Real-time testing and validation
- Easy sharing and collaboration
</Note>

### Task Execution Flow

Tasks can be executed in two ways:
- **Sequential**: Tasks are executed in the order they are defined
- **Hierarchical**: Tasks are assigned to agents based on their roles and expertise

The execution flow is defined when creating the crew:
```python Code
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential  # or Process.hierarchical
)
```

## Task Attributes

## Creating Tasks

There are two ways to create tasks in CrewAI: using **YAML configuration (recommended)** or defining them **directly in code**.

### YAML Configuration (Recommended)

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define tasks. We strongly recommend using this approach to define tasks in your CrewAI projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the [Installation](/en/installation) section, navigate to the `src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml` file and modify the template to match your specific task requirements.

<Note>
Variables in your YAML files (like `{topic}`) will be replaced with values from your inputs when running the crew:
```python Code
crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI Agents'})
```
</Note>

Here's an example of how to configure tasks using YAML:

```yaml tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2025.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher
  guardrail: ensure each bullet contains a minimum of 100 words

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  markdown: true
  output_file: report.md
```

To use this YAML configuration in your code, create a crew class that inherits from `CrewBase`:

```python crew.py
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
  def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'], # type: ignore[index]
      verbose=True
    )

  @task
  def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['research_task'] # type: ignore[index]
    )

  @task
  def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'] # type: ignore[index]
    )

  @crew
  def crew(self) -> Crew:
    return Crew(
      agents=[
        self.researcher(),
        self.reporting_analyst()
      ],
      tasks=[
        self.research_task(),
        self.reporting_task()
      ],
      process=Process.sequential
    )
```

<Note>
The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
</Note>

### Direct Code Definition (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can define tasks directly in your code without using YAML configuration:

```python task.py
from crewai import Task

research_task = Task(
    description="""
        Conduct a thorough research about AI Agents.
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2025.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI Agents
    """,
    agent=researcher
)

reporting_task = Task(
    description="""
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    """,
    agent=reporting_analyst,
    markdown=True,  # Enable markdown formatting for the final output
    output_file="report.md"
)
```

<Tip>
  Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` CrewAI's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.
</Tip>

## Task Output

Understanding task outputs is crucial for building effective AI workflows. CrewAI provides a structured way to handle task results through the `TaskOutput` class, which supports multiple output formats and can be easily passed between tasks.

The output of a task in CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the `TaskOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.

By default, the `TaskOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `TaskOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Task` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Task Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the task.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.                                             |
| **Agent**         | `agent`         | `str`                      | The agent that executed the task.                                                                  |
| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Task Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Task Outputs

Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Task` object. The `TaskOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example task
task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the task output
task_output = task.output

print(f"Task Description: {task_output.description}")
print(f"Task Summary: {task_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {task_output.raw}")
if task_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(task_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if task_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {task_output.pydantic}")
```

## Markdown Output Formatting

The `markdown` parameter enables automatic markdown formatting for task outputs. When set to `True`, the task will instruct the agent to format the final answer using proper Markdown syntax.

### Using Markdown Formatting

```python Code
# Example task with markdown formatting enabled
formatted_task = Task(
    description="Create a comprehensive report on AI trends",
    expected_output="A well-structured report with headers, sections, and bullet points",
    agent=reporter_agent,
    markdown=True  # Enable automatic markdown formatting
)
```

When `markdown=True`, the agent will receive additional instructions to format the output using:
- `#` for headers
- `**text**` for bold text
- `*text*` for italic text
- `-` or `*` for bullet points
- `` `code` `` for inline code
- ``` ```language ``` for code blocks

### YAML Configuration with Markdown

```yaml tasks.yaml
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the market data and create a detailed report
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive analysis with charts and key findings
  agent: analyst
  markdown: true  # Enable markdown formatting
  output_file: analysis.md
```

### Benefits of Markdown Output

- **Consistent Formatting**: Ensures all outputs follow proper markdown conventions
- **Better Readability**: Structured content with headers, lists, and emphasis
- **Documentation Ready**: Output can be directly used in documentation systems
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Markdown is universally supported

<Note>
The markdown formatting instructions are automatically added to the task prompt when `markdown=True`, so you don't need to specify formatting requirements in your task description.
</Note>

## Task Dependencies and Context

Tasks can depend on the output of other tasks using the `context` attribute. For example:

```python Code
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    agent=researcher
)

analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the research findings and identify key trends",
    expected_output="Analysis report of AI trends",
    agent=analyst,
    context=[research_task]  # This task will wait for research_task to complete
)
```

## Task Guardrails

Task guardrails provide a way to validate and transform task outputs before they
are passed to the next task. This feature helps ensure data quality and provides
feedback to agents when their output doesn't meet specific criteria.

**Guardrails can be defined in two ways:**
1. **Function-based guardrails**: Python functions that implement custom validation logic
2. **String-based guardrails**: Natural language descriptions that are automatically converted to LLM-powered validation

### Function-Based Guardrails

To add a function-based guardrail to a task, provide a validation function through the `guardrail` parameter:

```python Code
from typing import Tuple, Union, Dict, Any
from crewai import TaskOutput

def validate_blog_content(result: TaskOutput) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    """Validate blog content meets requirements."""
    try:
        # Check word count
        word_count = len(result.split())
        if word_count > 200:
            return (False, "Blog content exceeds 200 words")

        # Additional validation logic here
        return (True, result.strip())
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, "Unexpected error during validation")

blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post about AI",
    expected_output="A blog post under 200 words",
    agent=blog_agent,
    guardrail=validate_blog_content  # Add the guardrail function
)
```

### Guardrail Function Requirements

1. **Function Signature**:
   - Must accept exactly one parameter (the task output)
   - Should return a tuple of `(bool, Any)`
   - Type hints are recommended but optional

2. **Return Values**:
   - On success: it returns a tuple of `(bool, Any)`. For example: `(True, validated_result)`
   - On Failure: it returns a tuple of `(bool, str)`. For example: `(False, "Error message explain the failure")`

### String-Based Guardrails

String-based guardrails allow you to describe validation criteria in natural language. When you provide a string instead of a function, CrewAI automatically converts it to an `LLMGuardrail` that uses an AI agent to validate the task output.

#### Using String Guardrails in Python

```python Code
from crewai import Task

# Simple string-based guardrail
blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post about AI",
    expected_output="A blog post under 200 words",
    agent=blog_agent,
    guardrail="Ensure the blog post is under 200 words and includes practical examples"
)

# More complex validation criteria
research_task = Task(
    description="Research AI trends for 2025",
    expected_output="A comprehensive research report",
    agent=research_agent,
    guardrail="Ensure each finding includes a credible source and is backed by recent data from 2024-2025"
)
```

#### Using String Guardrails in YAML

```yaml
research_task:
  description: Research the latest AI developments
  expected_output: A list of 10 bullet points about AI
  agent: researcher
  guardrail: ensure each bullet contains a minimum of 100 words

validation_task:
  description: Validate the research findings
  expected_output: A validation report
  agent: validator
  guardrail: confirm all sources are from reputable publications and published within the last 2 years
```

#### How String Guardrails Work

When you provide a string guardrail, CrewAI automatically:
1. Creates an `LLMGuardrail` instance using the string as validation criteria
2. Uses the task's agent LLM to power the validation
3. Creates a temporary validation agent that checks the output against your criteria
4. Returns detailed feedback if validation fails

This approach is ideal when you want to use natural language to describe validation rules without writing custom validation functions.

### LLMGuardrail Class

The `LLMGuardrail` class is the underlying mechanism that powers string-based guardrails. You can also use it directly for more advanced control:

```python Code
from crewai import Task
from crewai.tasks.llm_guardrail import LLMGuardrail
from crewai.llm import LLM

# Create a custom LLMGuardrail with specific LLM
custom_guardrail = LLMGuardrail(
    description="Ensure the response contains exactly 5 bullet points with proper citations",
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
)

task = Task(
    description="Research AI safety measures",
    expected_output="A detailed analysis with bullet points",
    agent=research_agent,
    guardrail=custom_guardrail
)
```

**Note**: When you use a string guardrail, CrewAI automatically creates an `LLMGuardrail` instance using your task's agent LLM. Using `LLMGuardrail` directly gives you more control over the validation process and LLM selection.

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Structured Error Responses**:
```python Code
from crewai import TaskOutput, LLMGuardrail

def validate_with_context(result: TaskOutput) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    try:
        # Main validation logic
        validated_data = perform_validation(result)
        return (True, validated_data)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return (False, f"VALIDATION_ERROR: {str(e)}")
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, str(e))
```

2. **Error Categories**:
   - Use specific error codes
   - Include relevant context
   - Provide actionable feedback

3. **Validation Chain**:
```python Code
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple, Union
from crewai import TaskOutput

def complex_validation(result: TaskOutput) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    """Chain multiple validation steps."""
    # Step 1: Basic validation
    if not result:
        return (False, "Empty result")

    # Step 2: Content validation
    try:
        validated = validate_content(result)
        if not validated:
            return (False, "Invalid content")

        # Step 3: Format validation
        formatted = format_output(validated)
        return (True, formatted)
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, str(e))
```

### Handling Guardrail Results

When a guardrail returns `(False, error)`:
1. The error is sent back to the agent
2. The agent attempts to fix the issue
3. The process repeats until:
   - The guardrail returns `(True, result)`
   - Maximum retries are reached

Example with retry handling:
```python Code
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Union
from crewai import TaskOutput, Task

def validate_json_output(result: TaskOutput) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    """Validate and parse JSON output."""
    try:
        # Try to parse as JSON
        data = json.loads(result)
        return (True, data)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        return (False, "Invalid JSON format")

task = Task(
    description="Generate a JSON report",
    expected_output="A valid JSON object",
    agent=analyst,
    guardrail=validate_json_output,
    max_retries=3  # Limit retry attempts
)
```

## Getting Structured Consistent Outputs from Tasks

<Note>
It's also important to note that the output of the final task of a crew becomes the final output of the actual crew itself.
</Note>

### Using `output_pydantic`
The `output_pydantic` property allows you to define a Pydantic model that the task output should conform to. This ensures that the output is not only structured but also validated according to the Pydantic model.

Here's an example demonstrating how to use output_pydantic:

```python Code
import json

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Blog(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str


blog_agent = Agent(
    role="Blog Content Generator Agent",
    goal="Generate a blog title and content",
    backstory="""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging and informative blog posts.""",
    verbose=False,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)

task1 = Task(
    description="""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the content is under 200 words.""",
    expected_output="A compelling blog title and well-written content.",
    agent=blog_agent,
    output_pydantic=Blog,
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[blog_agent],
    tasks=[task1],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing
print("Accessing Properties - Option 1")
title = result["title"]
content = result["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 2: Accessing Properties Directly from the Pydantic Model
print("Accessing Properties - Option 2")
title = result.pydantic.title
content = result.pydantic.content
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 3: Accessing Properties Using the to_dict() Method
print("Accessing Properties - Option 3")
output_dict = result.to_dict()
title = output_dict["title"]
content = output_dict["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 4: Printing the Entire Blog Object
print("Accessing Properties - Option 5")
print("Blog:", result)

```
In this example:
* A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields.
* The task task1 uses the output_pydantic property to specify that its output should conform to the Blog model.
* After executing the crew, you can access the structured output in multiple ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output
1. Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can directly access the fields using result["field_name"]. This works because the CrewOutput class implements the __getitem__ method.
2. Directly from Pydantic Model: Access the attributes directly from the result.pydantic object.
3. Using to_dict() Method: Convert the output to a dictionary and access the fields.
4. Printing the Entire Object: Simply print the result object to see the structured output.

### Using `output_json`
The `output_json` property allows you to define the expected output in JSON format. This ensures that the task's output is a valid JSON structure that can be easily parsed and used in your application.

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `output_json`:

```python Code
import json

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel


# Define the Pydantic model for the blog
class Blog(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str


# Define the agent
blog_agent = Agent(
    role="Blog Content Generator Agent",
    goal="Generate a blog title and content",
    backstory="""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging and informative blog posts.""",
    verbose=False,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)

# Define the task with output_json set to the Blog model
task1 = Task(
    description="""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the content is under 200 words.""",
    expected_output="A JSON object with 'title' and 'content' fields.",
    agent=blog_agent,
    output_json=Blog,
)

# Instantiate the crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[blog_agent],
    tasks=[task1],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
)

# Kickoff the crew to execute the task
result = crew.kickoff()

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing
print("Accessing Properties - Option 1")
title = result["title"]
content = result["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 2: Printing the Entire Blog Object
print("Accessing Properties - Option 2")
print("Blog:", result)
```

In this example:
* A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields, which is used to specify the structure of the JSON output.
* The task task1 uses the output_json property to indicate that it expects a JSON output conforming to the Blog model.
* After executing the crew, you can access the structured JSON output in two ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output

1. Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can access the fields directly using result["field_name"]. This is possible because the CrewOutput class implements the __getitem__ method, allowing you to treat the output like a dictionary. In this option, we're retrieving the title and content from the result.
2. Printing the Entire Blog Object: By printing result, you get the string representation of the CrewOutput object. Since the __str__ method is implemented to return the JSON output, this will display the entire output as a formatted string representing the Blog object.

By using output_pydantic or output_json, you ensure that your tasks produce outputs in a consistent and structured format, making it easier to process and utilize the data within your application or across multiple tasks.

## Integrating Tools with Tasks

Leverage tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```python Code
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

## Referring to Other Tasks

In CrewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the task:

```python Code
# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI Ops",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI Ops developments",
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output="Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long",
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```python Code
#...

list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.

```python Code
# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
    # Do something after the task is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Task completed!
        Task: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the `output` attribute of the task object:

```python Code
# ...
task1 = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f"""
    Task completed!
    Task: {task1.output.description}
    Output: {task1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

- Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
- Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.



## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python Code
# ...

save_output_task = Task(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in CrewAI.
By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit.
Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential,
ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.
