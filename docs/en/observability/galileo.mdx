# Galileo Integration

This guide demonstrates how to integrate **Galileo** with **CrewAI** 
using OpenTelemetry for comprehensive tracing and evaluation. 
By the end of this guide, you will be able to trace your CrewAI agents, 
monitor their performance and 
Galileo's powerful observability platform.

> **What is Galileo?** [Galileo](https://galileo.ai/) is AI evaluation and observability
platform that delivers end-to-end tracing, evaluation,
and monitoring for AI applications. It enables teams to capture ground truth,
create robust guardrails, and run systematic experiments with
built-in experiment tracking and performance analytics—ensuring reliability,
transparency, and continuous improvement across the AI lifecycle.

## Getting started

We'll walk through a simple example of using CrewAI and integrating it
with Galileo's via OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability and evaluation.
This tutorial follows the [CrewAI quickstart](/en/quickstart) and shows how to add
Galileo's [CrewAIEventListener](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/sdk-api/python/reference/handlers/crewai/handler),
an event handler implemented on top of OpenTelemetry (OTel). For more information, see 
Galileo’s [Add Galileo to a CrewAI Application](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/how-to-guides/third-party-integrations/add-galileo-to-crewai/add-galileo-to-crewai)
how-to guide.

> **Note** This tutorail assumes you have completed the [CrewAI quickstart](/en/quickstart).
If you want a completed comprehensive example, see the Galileo [CrewAI sdk-example repo](https://github.com/rungalileo/sdk-examples/tree/main/python/agent/crew-ai). 

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies for your app. Create a virtual environment using your preferred method, then install dependencies inside that environment using your preferred tool:

```bash
uv pip install galileo python-dotenv  
```

### Step 2: Add to the .env file from the CrewAI quickstart](/en/quickstart)


```bash
# Your Galileo API key
GALILEO_API_KEY="your-galileo-api-key"

# Your Galileo project name
GALILEO_PROJECT="your-galileo-project-name"

# The name of the Log stream you want to use for logging
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM="your-galileo-log-stream "
```

### Step 3: Import the dotenv package 

Add the following code at the top of your main.py file to import dotenv and load the .env file.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

### Step 4: Add the Galileo event listener

To enable logging with Galileo, you need to create an instance of the CrewAIEventListener.
Import the Galileo CrewAI handler package by adding the following code at the top of your main.py file:

```python
from galileo.handlers.crewai.handler import CrewAIEventListener
```

At the start of your run function, create the event listener:

```python 
def run():
    # Create the event listener
    CrewAIEventListener()
    # The rest of your existing code goes here
```

When you create the listener instance, it is automatically registered with CrewAI.

### Step 5: Run your crew

Run your crew with the CrewAI CLI:

```
crewai run
```

### Step 6: View the traces in Galileo

Once your crew has finished, the traces will be flushed an appear in Galileo.

## Understanding the Galileo Integration

Galileo integrates with CrewAI by registering an event listener that captures Crew execution events (e.g., agent actions, tool calls, model responses) and forwards them to Galileo for observability and evaluation. Under the hood, this integration is built on OpenTelemetry (OTel) for standardized tracing and telemetry collection.

### Register the event listener

At the beginning of your run() function (or before starting the Crew), instantiate the Galileo event listener:

```python

def run():
    # Create the event listener (registers itself with CrewAI)
    CrewAIEventListener()

    # The rest of your existing code goes here
```

This is insturmented in [main.py](research_crew/src/research_crew/main.py).

### What this does 

Creating a CrewAIEventListener() instance is all that’s required to enable Galileo for a CrewAI run. When instantiated, the listener:

- Automatically registers itself with CrewAI
- Uses OpenTelemetry (OTel) to instrument Crew execution events
- Reads Galileo configuration from environment variables
- Logs all run data to the Galileo project and log stream specified by
  `GALILEO_PROJECT` and `GALILEO_LOG_STREAM`

No additional configuration or code changes are required. All data from this run is logged to the Galileo project and log stream specified by your environment configuration (for example, GALILEO_PROJECT and GALILEO_LOG_STREAM).
