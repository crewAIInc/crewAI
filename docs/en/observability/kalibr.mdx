# Kalibr — Production Reliability for CrewAI Agents

[Kalibr](https://kalibr.systems) is outcome-aware execution routing for CrewAI agents.
When your crew runs in production, Kalibr learns which model+tool configuration
works best for each agent role and routes automatically — before failures reach users.

## The Problem

CrewAI agents in production fail in ways that are hard to predict:

- A model starts returning lower quality outputs for a specific task type
- Latency spikes on one provider during peak hours
- A tool integration degrades without throwing exceptions

Kalibr detects these patterns from outcome signals and routes around them proactively.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kalibr crewai
```

## Setup

Get your API key from [kalibr.systems/dashboard](https://kalibr.systems/dashboard):

```bash
export KALIBR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Usage with CrewAI

Replace your direct LLM instantiation with KalibrLLM:

```python
from kalibr.integrations.crewai import KalibrLLM
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find key facts about a topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher",
    llm=KalibrLLM(
        goal="research_task",
        paths=["gpt-4o", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gemini-2.0-flash"],
    )
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write clear summaries",
    backstory="You write concise, accurate summaries",
    llm=KalibrLLM(
        goal="summarize_document",
        paths=["gpt-4o", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"],
    )
)

task = Task(
    description="Research and summarize the key trends in AI routing",
    agent=researcher
)

crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## How It Works

1. Kalibr observes which model+path combinations produce successful outcomes for each goal type
2. Traffic shifts toward paths that work, away from paths that degrade
3. When a path fails hard, Kalibr routes around it immediately

No manual tuning. No dashboards to check. Kalibr learns and adapts continuously.
