## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up observability and monitoring for Crew AI using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and exporting logs, traces, and metrics to SigNoz. With this integration, you can observe agent, model, tool performance, and track system-level metrics in SigNoz, giving you real-time visibility into latency, error rates, and usage trends for your Crew AI applications.

Instrumenting Crew AI in your LLM applications with telemetry ensures full observability across your AI workflows, making it easier to debug issues, optimize performance, and understand user interactions. By leveraging SigNoz, you can analyze correlated traces, logs, and metrics in unified dashboards, configure alerts, and gain actionable insights to continuously improve reliability, responsiveness, and user experience.

## Prerequisites

- SigNoz setup (choose one):
  - [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/) with an active ingestion key
  - Self-hosted SigNoz instance
- Internet access to send telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud
- Crew AI integrated into your app
- Basic understanding of AI Agents and tool calling workflow
- For Python: `pip` installed for managing Python packages and _(optional but recommended)_ a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies

## Monitoring Crew AI

No-code auto-instrumentation is recommended for quick setup with minimal code changes. It's ideal when you want to get observability up and running without modifying your application code and are leveraging standard instrumentor libraries.

**Step 1:** Install the necessary packages in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install \
  opentelemetry-distro \
  opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
  opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx \
  opentelemetry-instrumentation-system-metrics \
  openinference-instrumentation-crewai \
  crewai \
  crewai-tools
```

**Step 2:** Add Automatic Instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

**Step 3:** Configure logging level

To ensure logs are properly captured and exported, configure the root logger to emit logs at the INFO level or higher:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

This sets the minimum log level for the root logger to INFO, which ensures that `logger.info()` calls and higher severity logs (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) are captured by the OpenTelemetry logging auto-instrumentation and sent to SigNoz.

**Step 4:** Run an example

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Define your agents with roles and goals
researcher = Agent(
  role='Senior Research Analyst',
  goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science',
  backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
  Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
  You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=False,
  # You can pass an optional llm attribute specifying what model you wanna use.
  # llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5", temperature=0.7),
  tools=[search_tool]
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Tech Content Strategist',
  goal='Craft compelling content on tech advancements',
  backstory="""You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
  You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True
)

# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
  description="""Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024.
  Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts.""",
  expected_output="Full analysis report in bullet points",
  agent=researcher
)

task2 = Task(
  description="""Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog
  post that highlights the most significant AI advancements.
  Your post should be informative yet accessible, catering to a tech-savvy audience.
  Make it sound cool, avoid complex words so it doesn't sound like AI.""",
  expected_output="Full blog post of at least 4 paragraphs",
  agent=writer
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, writer],
  tasks=[task1, task2],
  verbose=True,
  process=Process.sequential
)

# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff()

print("######################")
print(result)
```

> 📌 Note: Before running this code, ensure that the API key of the specific LLM you are choosing is set as an env variable. In this example, since OpenAI is being used, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your working API key. Additionally, for this specific example, you need to create a [Serper account](https://serper.dev/), generate an API key, and set it as the environment variable `SERPER_API_KEY`.

**Step 5:** Run your application with auto-instrumentation

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=<service_name>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your_ingestion_key>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOG_CORRELATION=true \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

- **`<service_name>`** is the name of your service
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your_ingestion_key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- Replace `<your_run_command>` with the actual command you would use to run your application. For example: `python main.py`

> 📌 Note: Using self-hosted SigNoz? Most steps are identical. To adapt this guide, update the endpoint and remove the ingestion key header as shown in [Cloud → Self-Hosted](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/cloud-vs-self-hosted/#cloud-to-self-hosted).

## View Traces, Logs, and Metrics in SigNoz

Your Crew AI commands should now automatically emit traces, logs, and metrics.

You should be able to view traces in Signoz Cloud under the traces tab:
