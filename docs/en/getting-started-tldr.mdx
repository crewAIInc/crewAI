## What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents using two complementary primitives:

- **Flows** — event-driven workflows that manage state and control execution (the "backbone" of your app)
- **Crews** — teams of role-playing agents that collaborate on complex tasks (the "intelligence" within a Flow)

For any production app, start with a Flow and use Crews inside it.

## When to Use Flows vs. Crews

| Use Case | Architecture |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple automation / scripting | Single Flow with Python tasks |
| Complex research or content | Flow managing state → Crew performing research |
| Application backend | Flow handling requests → Crew generating content → Flow saving to DB |

**Rule of thumb:** Flow = control plane. Crew = execution unit. Use both.

## Installation

```bash
pip install crewai
# With built-in tools (web search, file read, etc.)
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Set your LLM API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Minimal Working Crew

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# 1. Define agents with role, goal, backstory
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Analyst",
    goal="Find the latest information on a given topic",
    backstory="Expert at gathering and synthesizing information from multiple sources.",
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Write clear, engaging summaries",
    backstory="Skilled communicator who turns research into readable content.",
)

# 2. Define tasks with description and expected output
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the top 3 trends in AI agents for 2025.",
    expected_output="A bullet-point list of 3 trends with one-sentence explanations.",
    agent=researcher,
)

write_task = Task(
    description="Write a 2-paragraph summary based on the research.",
    expected_output="A concise 2-paragraph summary in plain English.",
    agent=writer,
)

# 3. Assemble the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
)

# 4. Run it
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```
