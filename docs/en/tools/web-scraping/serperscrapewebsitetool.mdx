```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the tool and scrape a website:

```python Code
from crewai_tools import SerperScrapeWebsiteTool

# Initialize the tool for website scraping capabilities
tool = SerperScrapeWebsiteTool()

# Scrape a website with markdown formatting

    url="https://docs.crewai.com",
    include_markdown=True
)

# Scrape without markdown formatting for plain text
plain_result = tool.run(
    url="https://docs.crewai.com",
    include_markdown=False
)
