Integration tools let your agents hand off work to other automation platforms and managed AI services. Use them when a workflow needs to invoke an existing CrewAI deployment or delegate specialised tasks to providers such as Amazon Bedrock.

## **Available Tools**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CrewAI Run Automation Tool" icon="robot" href="/en/tools/integration/crewaiautomationtool">
    Invoke live CrewAI Platform automations, pass custom inputs, and poll for results directly from your agent.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bedrock Invoke Agent Tool" icon="aws" href="/en/tools/integration/bedrockinvokeagenttool">
    Call Amazon Bedrock Agents from your crews, reuse AWS guardrails, and stream responses back into the workflow.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## **Common Use Cases**

- **Chain automations**: Kick off an existing CrewAI deployment from within another crew or flow
- **Enterprise hand-off**: Route tasks to Bedrock Agents that already encapsulate company logic and guardrails
- **Hybrid workflows**: Combine CrewAI reasoning with downstream systems that expose their own agent APIs
- **Long-running jobs**: Poll external automations and merge the final results back into the current run

## **Quick Start Example**

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import InvokeCrewAIAutomationTool
from crewai_tools.aws.bedrock.agents.invoke_agent_tool import BedrockInvokeAgentTool

# External automation
analysis_automation = InvokeCrewAIAutomationTool(
    crew_api_url="https://analysis-crew.acme.crewai.com",
    crew_bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
    crew_name="Analysis Automation",
    crew_description="Runs the production-grade analysis pipeline",
)

# Managed agent on Bedrock
knowledge_router = BedrockInvokeAgentTool(
    agent_id="bedrock-agent-id",
    agent_alias_id="prod",
)

automation_strategist = Agent(
    role="Automation Strategist",
    goal="Orchestrate external automations and summarise their output",
    backstory="You coordinate enterprise workflows and know when to delegate tasks to specialised services.",
    tools=[analysis_automation, knowledge_router],
    verbose=True,
)

execute_playbook = Task(
    description="Run the analysis automation and ask the Bedrock agent for executive talking points.",
    agent=automation_strategist,
)

Crew(agents=[automation_strategist], tasks=[execute_playbook]).kickoff()
```

## **Best Practices**

- **Secure credentials**: Store API keys and bearer tokens in environment variables or a secrets manager
- **Plan for latency**: External automations may take longerâ€”set appropriate polling intervals and timeouts
- **Reuse sessions**: Bedrock Agents support session IDs so you can maintain context across multiple tool calls
- **Validate responses**: Normalise remote output (JSON, text, status codes) before forwarding it to downstream tasks
- **Monitor usage**: Track audit logs in CrewAI Platform or AWS CloudWatch to stay ahead of quota limits and failures
