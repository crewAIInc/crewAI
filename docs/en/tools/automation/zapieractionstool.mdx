# `ZapierActionsAdapter`

## Description

Use the Zapier adapter to list and call Zapier actions as CrewAI tools. This enables agents to trigger automations across thousands of apps.

## Installation

This adapter is included with `crewai-tools`. No extra install required.

## Environment Variables

- `ZAPIER_API_KEY` (required): Zapier API key. Get one from the Zapier Actions dashboard at https://actions.zapier.com/ (create an account, then generate an API key). You can also pass `zapier_api_key` directly when constructing the adapter.

## Example

```python Code
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools.adapters.zapier_adapter import ZapierActionsAdapter

adapter = ZapierActionsAdapter(api_key="your_zapier_api_key")
tools = adapter.tools()

agent = Agent(
    role="Automator",
    goal="Execute Zapier actions",
    backstory="Automation specialist",
    tools=tools,
    verbose=True,
)

task = Task(
    description="Create a new Google Sheet and add a row using Zapier actions",
    expected_output="Confirmation with created resource IDs",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Notes & limits

- The adapter lists available actions for your key and creates `BaseTool` wrappers dynamically.
- Handle actionâ€‘specific required fields in your task instructions or tool call.
- Rate limits depend on your Zapier plan; see the Zapier Actions docs.

## Notes

- The adapter fetches available actions and generates `BaseTool` wrappers dynamically.
