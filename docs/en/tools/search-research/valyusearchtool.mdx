The `ValyuSearchTool` provides an interface to the Valyu Search API, enabling CrewAI agents to search across web, academic, financial, healthcare, biomedical and proprietary data sources through a single API. It allows for specifying search types, relevance thresholds, date ranges, included/excluded sources, and response lengths.

## Installation

To use the `ValyuSearchTool`, you need to install the `valyu` library:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]' valyu
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure your Valyu API key is set as an environment variable:

```bash
export VALYU_API_KEY='your_valyu_api_key'
```

Get an API key at https://platform.valyu.ai/ (sign up, then create a key from the dashboard).

## Example Usage

Here's how to initialize and use the `ValyuSearchTool` within a CrewAI agent:

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import ValyuSearchTool

# Ensure the VALYU_API_KEY environment variable is set
# os.environ["VALYU_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_VALYU_API_KEY"

# Initialize the tool
valyu_tool = ValyuSearchTool()

# Create an agent that uses the tool
researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Analyst',
    goal='Find comprehensive information from web and academic sources',
    backstory='An expert research analyst with access to diverse data sources.',
    tools=[valyu_tool],
    verbose=True
)

# Create a task for the agent
research_task = Task(
    description='Search for the latest research on large language models.',
    expected_output='A comprehensive report summarizing key findings from web and academic sources.',
    agent=researcher
)

# Form the crew and kick it off
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## Configuration Options

The `ValyuSearchTool` accepts the following arguments during initialization or when calling the `run` method:

- `query` (str): **Required**. The search query string.
- `search_type` (Literal["all", "web", "proprietary", "news"], optional): The type of search to perform. Defaults to `"all"`.
- `max_num_results` (int, optional): The maximum number of search results to return (1-20). Defaults to `10`.
- `relevance_threshold` (float, optional): Minimum relevance score for results (0.0-1.0). Higher values return more relevant results. Defaults to `0.5`.
- `included_sources` (Sequence[str], optional): A list of specific sources or domains to include in the search. Defaults to `None`.
- `excluded_sources` (Sequence[str], optional): A list of specific sources or domains to exclude from the search. Defaults to `None`.
- `start_date` (str, optional): Start date for filtering results (YYYY-MM-DD format). Defaults to `None`.
- `end_date` (str, optional): End date for filtering results (YYYY-MM-DD format). Defaults to `None`.
- `response_length` (Literal["short", "medium", "large", "max"], optional): Content length per result. Defaults to `"short"`.
- `fast_mode` (bool, optional): Enable reduced latency with shorter results. Defaults to `False`.
- `country_code` (str, optional): 2-letter ISO country code to bias results geographically. Defaults to `None`.

## Advanced Usage

You can configure the tool with custom parameters:

```python
# Example: Initialize with specific parameters for academic research
academic_valyu_tool = ValyuSearchTool(
    search_type='proprietary',
    max_num_results=15,
    relevance_threshold=0.7,
    response_length='medium'
)

# The agent will use these defaults
agent_with_custom_tool = Agent(
    role="Academic Researcher",
    goal="Find high-quality academic and research content",
    tools=[academic_valyu_tool]
)
```

```python
# Example: Initialize for news search with date filtering
news_valyu_tool = ValyuSearchTool(
    search_type='news',
    max_num_results=10,
    start_date='2024-01-01',
    end_date='2024-12-31'
)

# The agent will use these defaults
news_agent = Agent(
    role="News Analyst",
    goal="Monitor and analyze recent news articles",
    tools=[news_valyu_tool]
)
```

## Features

- **Unified Search**: Access web, academic, financial, and proprietary data sources through a single API
- **Multiple Search Types**: Choose between "all", "web", "proprietary", or "news" search modes
- **Academic Content**: Access research papers from arXiv, PubMed, medRxiv, BioRxiv and other scholarly sources
- **Financial Data**: Search SEC filings, market data, and financial reports
- **Relevance Control**: Fine-tune result quality with configurable relevance thresholds
- **Date Filtering**: Limit results to specific time periods
- **Source Control**: Include or exclude specific domains and data sources
- **Geographic Targeting**: Bias results based on country codes

## Data Sources

Valyu provides access to diverse data sources including:

- **Web**: Real-time web search across the internet
- **Academic**: arXiv, PubMed, scholarly papers, and research publications
- **Financial**: Stock prices, SEC filings, market metrics, and financial reports
- **Medical**: Peer-reviewed literature, clinical trials, FDA drug labels
- **Proprietary**: Licensed datasets and specialized content providers

## Response Format

The tool returns search results as a JSON string containing:
- Search results with titles, URLs, and content snippets
- Relevance scores for each result
- Source attribution and metadata
- Full-text content based on the configured response length

Content for each result is returned based on the `response_length` parameter to balance between comprehensive information and context window efficiency.
