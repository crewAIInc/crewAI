## When to use

- You need deterministic orchestration, branching, and resumable execution.
- You need explicit state transitions across steps.
- You need persistence, routing, and event-driven control.

## When not to use

- A single prompt/response interaction is enough.
- You only need one agent call without orchestration logic.

## Core decisions

| Decision | Choose this when |
|---|---|
| Unstructured state | Fast prototyping, highly dynamic fields |
| Structured state | Stable contracts, team development, type safety |
| `@persist()` | Long-running workflows and recovery requirements |
| Router labels | Deterministic branch handling |
