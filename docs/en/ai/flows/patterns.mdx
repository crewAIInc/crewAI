## Recommended patterns

1. Triage router flow
- Inputs: normalized request payload
- Output: deterministic route label + action
- Reference: [/en/concepts/flows](/en/concepts/flows)

2. Flowstate chat history
- Inputs: `session_id`, `last_user_message`
- Output: assistant reply + compact context state
- Reference: [/en/learn/flowstate-chat-history](/en/learn/flowstate-chat-history)

3. Human feedback gates
- Inputs: generated artifact + reviewer feedback
- Output: approved/rejected/revision path
- Reference: [/en/learn/human-feedback-in-flows](/en/learn/human-feedback-in-flows)

## Pattern requirements

- declare explicit input schema
- define expected output shape
- list failure modes and retries
