## When to use

- You need specialized behavior with explicit role and goal.
- You need tool-enabled execution under constraints.

## When not to use

- Static transformations are enough without model reasoning.
- Task can be solved by deterministic code only.

## Core decisions

| Decision | Choose this when |
|---|---|
| Single agent | Narrow scope, low coordination needs |
| Multi-agent crew | Distinct expertise and review loops needed |
| Tool-enabled agent | Model needs external actions or data |
