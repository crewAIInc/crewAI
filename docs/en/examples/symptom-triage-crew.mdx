# Symptom Triage Crew

## Overview

This example demonstrates an agentic AI workflow using CrewAI, where multiple
specialized agents collaborate to perform basic healthcare triage.

Each agent has a clear responsibility, and decisions emerge through
collaboration rather than a single monolithic prompt.

---

## Agents

### Symptom Collector Agent
**Role**
- Extract symptoms from raw patient input
- Normalize symptom descriptions

**Example Input**
"I have fever, cough, and headache"

---

### Risk Assessment Agent
**Role**
- Analyze symptom combinations
- Classify risk as low, medium, or high

---

### Care Advisor Agent
**Role**
- Suggest next steps based on risk level
- Recommend rest or medical consultation

---

## Agentic Workflow

1. User provides a natural language symptom description
2. Symptom Collector extracts structured symptoms
3. Risk Assessment agent evaluates severity
4. Care Advisor generates guidance
5. Final response is returned to the user

---

## Why This Is Agentic AI

- Each agent has a single responsibility
- Reasoning is distributed across agents
- No single agent controls the full decision
- Collaboration produces the final output

## Conceptual Example

```python
# Conceptual illustration of input interpolation in CrewAI

crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        {
            "role": "Symptom Collector",
            "goal": "Extract symptoms from: {patient_input}"
        },
        {
            "role": "Risk Assessor",
            "goal": "Assess severity of: {patient_input}"
        },
        {
            "role": "Care Advisor",
            "goal": "Suggest next steps for: {patient_input}"
        }
    ],
    task="Perform symptom triage using the provided patient input."
)

result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={
        "patient_input": "I have fever, cough, and headache"
    }
)

print(result)
