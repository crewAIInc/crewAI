Symptom Triage Crew

//Overview

This example demonstrates an agentic AI workflow using CrewAI, where multiple
specialized agents collaborate to perform basic healthcare triage.

Each agent has a clear role, and decisions are made through collaboration
rather than a single monolithic prompt.



//Agents

Symptom Collector Agent
Role
- Extract symptoms from raw patient input
- Normalize symptom descriptions

Example Input
"I have fever, cough, and headache"


Risk Assessment Agent
Role
- Analyze symptom combinations
- Classify risk as low, medium, or high


Care Advisor Agent
Role
- Suggest next steps based on risk level
- Recommend rest or medical consultation


//Agentic Workflow

1. User provides a natural language symptom description
2. Symptom Collector extracts structured symptoms
3. Risk Assessment agent evaluates severity
4. Care Advisor generates guidance
5. Final response is returned to the user


//Why This Is Agentic AI

- Each agent has a single responsibility
- Reasoning is distributed across agents
- No single agent controls the full decision
- Collaboration produces the final output


//Use Cases

- Healthcare triage assistants
- Educational medical chatbots
- Agent-based reasoning demos
