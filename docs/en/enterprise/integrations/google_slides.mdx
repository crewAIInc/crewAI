## Overview

Enable your agents to create, edit, and manage Google Slides presentations. Create presentations, update content, import data from Google Sheets, manage pages and thumbnails, and streamline your presentation workflows with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Google Slides integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A Google account with Google Slides access
- Connected your Google account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up Google Slides Integration

### 1. Connect Your Google Account

1. Navigate to [CrewAI AMP Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
2. Find **Google Slides** in the Authentication Integrations section
3. Click **Connect** and complete the OAuth flow
4. Grant the necessary permissions for presentations, spreadsheets, and drive access
5. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

### 2. Install Required Package

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

### 3. Environment Variable Setup

<Note>
  To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the
  `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise
  Token.
</Note>

```bash
export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
```
