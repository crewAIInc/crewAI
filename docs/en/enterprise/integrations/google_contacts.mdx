## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure your Google account has appropriate permissions for contacts access
- Verify that the OAuth connection includes required scopes for Google Contacts API
- Check that directory access permissions are granted for organization contacts

**Resource Name Format Issues**
- Ensure resource names follow the correct format (e.g., 'people/c123456789' for contacts)
- Verify that contact group resource names use the format 'contactGroups/groupId'
- Check that resource names exist and are accessible

**Search and Query Issues**
- Ensure search queries are properly formatted and not empty
- Use appropriate readMask fields for the data you need
- Verify that search sources are correctly specified (contacts vs profiles)

**Contact Creation and Updates**
- Ensure required fields are provided when creating contacts
- Verify that email addresses and phone numbers are properly formatted
- Check that updatePersonFields parameter includes all fields being updated

**Directory Access Issues**
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to access organization directory
- Verify that directory sources are correctly specified
- Check that your organization allows API access to directory information

**Pagination and Limits**
- Be mindful of page size limits (varies by endpoint)
- Use pageToken for pagination through large result sets
- Respect API rate limits and implement appropriate delays

**Contact Groups and Organization**
