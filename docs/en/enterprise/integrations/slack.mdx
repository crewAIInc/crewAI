```json
[
  {
    "text": "I am a test message",
    "attachments": [
      {
        "text": "And here's an attachment!"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Rich Formatting with Sections
```json
[
  {
    "type": "section",
    "text": {
      "type": "mrkdwn",
      "text": "*Project Update*\nStatus: ✅ Complete"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "divider"
  },
  {
    "type": "section",
    "text": {
      "type": "plain_text",
      "text": "All tasks have been completed successfully."
    }
  }
]
```
