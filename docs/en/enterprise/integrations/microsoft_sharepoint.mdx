## Overview

Enable your agents to access and manage SharePoint sites, lists, and document libraries. Retrieve site information, manage list items, upload and organize files, and streamline your SharePoint workflows with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Microsoft SharePoint integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A Microsoft 365 account with SharePoint access
- Connected your Microsoft account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up Microsoft SharePoint Integration

### 1. Connect Your Microsoft Account

1. Navigate to [CrewAI AMP Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
2. Find **Microsoft SharePoint** in the Authentication Integrations section
3. Click **Connect** and complete the OAuth flow
4. Grant the necessary permissions for SharePoint sites and content access
5. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

### 2. Install Required Package

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

### 3. Environment Variable Setup

<Note>
  To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise Token.
</Note>

```bash
export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure your Microsoft account has appropriate permissions for SharePoint sites
- Verify that the OAuth connection includes required scopes (Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All)
- Check that you have access to the specific sites and lists you're trying to access

**Site and List ID Issues**
- Verify that site IDs and list IDs are correct and properly formatted
- Ensure that sites and lists exist and are accessible to your account
- Use the get_sites and get_site_lists actions to discover valid IDs

**Field and Schema Issues**
- Ensure field names match exactly with the SharePoint list schema
- Verify that required fields are included when creating or updating list items
- Check that field types and values are compatible with the list column definitions

**File Upload Issues**
- Ensure file paths are properly formatted and don't contain invalid characters
- Verify that you have write permissions to the target document library
- Check that file content is properly encoded for upload

**OData Query Issues**
- Use proper OData syntax for filter, select, expand, and orderby parameters
- Verify that property names used in queries exist in the target resources
- Test simple queries before building complex filter expressions

**Pagination and Performance**
- Use top and skip parameters appropriately for large result sets
- Implement proper pagination for lists with many items
- Consider using select parameters to return only needed properties

**Document Library Operations**
- Ensure you have proper permissions for document library operations
- Verify that drive item IDs are correct when deleting files or folders
- Check that file paths don't conflict with existing content
