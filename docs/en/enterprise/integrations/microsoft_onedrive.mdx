## Overview

Enable your agents to upload, download, and manage files and folders in Microsoft OneDrive. Automate file operations, organize content, create sharing links, and streamline your cloud storage workflows with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Microsoft OneDrive integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A Microsoft account with OneDrive access
- Connected your Microsoft account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up Microsoft OneDrive Integration

### 1. Connect Your Microsoft Account

1. Navigate to [CrewAI AMP Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
2. Find **Microsoft OneDrive** in the Authentication Integrations section
3. Click **Connect** and complete the OAuth flow
4. Grant the necessary permissions for file access
5. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

### 2. Install Required Package

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

### 3. Environment Variable Setup

<Note>
  To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise Token.
</Note>

```bash
export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Microsoft OneDrive Agent Setup

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent with Microsoft OneDrive capabilities
onedrive_agent = Agent(
    role="File Manager",
    goal="Manage files and folders in OneDrive efficiently",
    backstory="An AI assistant specialized in Microsoft OneDrive file operations and organization.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive']  # All OneDrive actions will be available
)

# Task to list files and create a folder
organize_files_task = Task(
    description="List all files in my OneDrive root directory and create a new folder called 'Project Documents'.",
    agent=onedrive_agent,
    expected_output="List of files displayed and new folder 'Project Documents' created."
)

# Run the task
crew = Crew(
    agents=[onedrive_agent],
    tasks=[organize_files_task]
)

crew.kickoff()
```

### File Upload and Management

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent focused on file operations
file_operator = Agent(
    role="File Operator",
    goal="Upload, download, and manage files with precision",
    backstory="An AI assistant skilled in file handling and content management.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive/upload_file', 'microsoft_onedrive/download_file', 'microsoft_onedrive/get_file_info']
)

# Task to upload and manage a file
file_management_task = Task(
    description="Upload a text file named 'report.txt' with content 'This is a sample report for the project.' Then get information about the uploaded file.",
    agent=file_operator,
    expected_output="File uploaded successfully and file information retrieved."
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[file_operator],
    tasks=[file_management_task]
)

crew.kickoff()
```

### File Organization and Sharing

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent for file organization and sharing
file_organizer = Agent(
    role="File Organizer",
    goal="Organize files and create sharing links for collaboration",
    backstory="An AI assistant that excels at organizing files and managing sharing permissions.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive/search_files', 'microsoft_onedrive/move_item', 'microsoft_onedrive/share_item', 'microsoft_onedrive/create_folder']
)

# Task to organize and share files
organize_share_task = Task(
    description="Search for files containing 'presentation' in the name, create a folder called 'Presentations', move the found files to this folder, and create a view-only sharing link for the folder.",
    agent=file_organizer,
    expected_output="Files organized into 'Presentations' folder and sharing link created."
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[file_organizer],
    tasks=[organize_share_task]

crew.kickoff()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Ensure your Microsoft account has the necessary permissions for file access (e.g., `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`).
- Verify that the OAuth connection includes all required scopes.

**File Upload Issues**
- Ensure `file_name` and `content` are provided for file uploads.
- Content must be Base64 encoded for binary files.
- Check that you have write permissions to OneDrive.

**File/Folder ID Issues**
- Double-check item IDs for correctness when accessing specific files or folders.
- Item IDs are returned by other operations like `list_files` or `search_files`.
- Ensure the referenced items exist and are accessible.

**Search and Filter Operations**
- Use appropriate search terms for `search_files` operations.
- For `filter` parameters, use proper OData syntax.

**File Operations (Copy/Move)**
- For `move_item`, ensure both `item_id` and `parent_id` are provided.
- For `copy_item`, only `item_id` is required; `parent_id` defaults to root if not specified.
- Verify that destination folders exist and are accessible.

**Sharing Link Creation**
- Ensure the item exists before creating sharing links.
- Choose appropriate `type` and `scope` based on your sharing requirements.
- `anonymous` scope allows access without sign-in; `organization` requires organizational account.
