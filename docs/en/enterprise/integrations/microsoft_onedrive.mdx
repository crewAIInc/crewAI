## Usage Examples

### Basic Microsoft OneDrive Agent Setup

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent with Microsoft OneDrive capabilities
onedrive_agent = Agent(
    role="File Manager",
    goal="Manage files and folders in OneDrive efficiently",
    backstory="An AI assistant specialized in Microsoft OneDrive file operations and organization.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive']  # All OneDrive actions will be available
)

# Task to list files and create a folder
organize_files_task = Task(
    description="List all files in my OneDrive root directory and create a new folder called 'Project Documents'.",
    agent=onedrive_agent,
    expected_output="List of files displayed and new folder 'Project Documents' created."
)

# Run the task
crew = Crew(
    agents=[onedrive_agent],
    tasks=[organize_files_task]
)

crew.kickoff()
```

### File Upload and Management

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent focused on file operations
file_operator = Agent(
    role="File Operator",
    goal="Upload, download, and manage files with precision",
    backstory="An AI assistant skilled in file handling and content management.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive/upload_file', 'microsoft_onedrive/download_file', 'microsoft_onedrive/get_file_info']
)

# Task to upload and manage a file
file_management_task = Task(
    description="Upload a text file named 'report.txt' with content 'This is a sample report for the project.' Then get information about the uploaded file.",
    agent=file_operator,
    expected_output="File uploaded successfully and file information retrieved."
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[file_operator],
    tasks=[file_management_task]
)

crew.kickoff()
```

### File Organization and Sharing

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent for file organization and sharing
file_organizer = Agent(
    role="File Organizer",
    goal="Organize files and create sharing links for collaboration",
    backstory="An AI assistant that excels at organizing files and managing sharing permissions.",
    apps=['microsoft_onedrive/search_files', 'microsoft_onedrive/move_item', 'microsoft_onedrive/share_item', 'microsoft_onedrive/create_folder']
)

# Task to organize and share files
organize_share_task = Task(
    description="Search for files containing 'presentation' in the name, create a folder called 'Presentations', move the found files to this folder, and create a view-only sharing link for the folder.",
    agent=file_organizer,
    expected_output="Files organized into 'Presentations' folder and sharing link created."
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[file_organizer],
    tasks=[organize_share_task]
)

crew.kickoff()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Ensure your Microsoft account has the necessary permissions for file access (e.g., `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`).
- Verify that the OAuth connection includes all required scopes.

**File Upload Issues**
- Ensure `file_name` and `content` are provided for file uploads.
- Content must be Base64 encoded for binary files.
- Check that you have write permissions to OneDrive.

**File/Folder ID Issues**
- Double-check item IDs for correctness when accessing specific files or folders.
- Item IDs are returned by other operations like `list_files` or `search_files`.
- Ensure the referenced items exist and are accessible.

**Search and Filter Operations**
- Use appropriate search terms for `search_files` operations.
- For `filter` parameters, use proper OData syntax.

**File Operations (Copy/Move)**
- For `move_item`, ensure both `item_id` and `parent_id` are provided.
- For `copy_item`, only `item_id` is required; `parent_id` defaults to root if not specified.
- Verify that destination folders exist and are accessible.

**Sharing Link Creation**
- Ensure the item exists before creating sharing links.
- Choose appropriate `type` and `scope` based on your sharing requirements.
- `anonymous` scope allows access without sign-in; `organization` requires organizational account.
