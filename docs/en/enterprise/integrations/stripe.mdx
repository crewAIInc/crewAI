## Subscription Status Reference

Understanding subscription statuses:

- **incomplete** - Subscription requires payment method or payment confirmation
- **incomplete_expired** - Subscription expired before payment was confirmed
- **trialing** - Subscription is in trial period
- **active** - Subscription is active and current
- **past_due** - Payment failed but subscription is still active
- **canceled** - Subscription has been canceled
- **unpaid** - Payment failed and subscription is no longer active

## Metadata Usage

Metadata allows you to store additional information about customers, subscriptions, and products:

```json
{
  "customer_segment": "enterprise",
  "acquisition_source": "google_ads",
  "lifetime_value": "high",
  "custom_field_1": "value1"
}
```

This integration enables comprehensive payment and subscription management automation, allowing your AI agents to handle billing operations seamlessly within your Stripe ecosystem.
