## Overview

Enable your agents to manage issues, projects, and workflows through Jira. Create and update issues, track project progress, manage assignments, and streamline your project management with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Jira integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A Jira account with appropriate project permissions
- Connected your Jira account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up Jira Integration

### 1. Connect Your Jira Account

1. Navigate to [CrewAI AMP Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
2. Find **Jira** in the Authentication Integrations section
3. Click **Connect** and complete the OAuth flow
4. Grant the necessary permissions for issue and project management
5. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

### 2. Install Required Package

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

### 3. Environment Variable Setup

<Note>
  To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise Token.
</Note>

```bash
export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Jira Agent Setup

jira_agent = Agent(
    role="Issue Manager",
    goal="Manage Jira issues and track project progress efficiently",
    backstory="An AI assistant specialized in issue tracking and project management.",
    apps=['jira']  # All Jira actions will be available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure your Jira account has necessary permissions for the target projects
- Verify that the OAuth connection includes required scopes for Jira API
- Check if you have create/edit permissions for issues in the specified projects

**Invalid Project or Issue Keys**
- Double-check project keys and issue keys for correct format (e.g., "PROJ-123")
- Ensure projects exist and are accessible to your account
- Verify that issue keys reference existing issues

**Issue Type and Status Issues**
- Use JIRA_GET_ISSUE_TYPES_BY_PROJECT to get valid issue types for a project
- Use JIRA_GET_ISSUE_STATUS_BY_PROJECT to get valid statuses
- Ensure issue types and statuses are available in the target project

**JQL Query Problems**
- Test JQL queries in Jira's issue search before using in API calls
- Ensure field names in JQL are spelled correctly and exist in your Jira instance
- Use proper JQL syntax for complex queries

**Custom Fields and Schema Issues**
- Use JIRA_DESCRIBE_ACTION_SCHEMA to get the correct schema for complex issue types
- Ensure custom field IDs are correct (e.g., "customfield_10001")
- Verify that custom fields are available in the target project and issue type

**Filter Formula Issues**
- Ensure filter formulas follow the correct JSON structure for disjunctive normal form
- Use valid field names that exist in your Jira configuration
- Test simple filters before building complex multi-condition queries
