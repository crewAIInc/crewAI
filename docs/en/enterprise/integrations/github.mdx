## Overview

Enable your agents to manage repositories, issues, and releases through GitHub. Create and update issues, manage releases, track project development, and streamline your software development workflow with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the GitHub integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A GitHub account with appropriate repository permissions
- Connected your GitHub account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up GitHub Integration

### 1. Connect Your GitHub Account

1. Navigate to [CrewAI AMP Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
2. Find **GitHub** in the Authentication Integrations section
3. Click **Connect** and complete the OAuth flow
4. Grant the necessary permissions for repository and issue management
5. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

### 2. Install Required Package

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

### 3. Environment Variable Setup

<Note>
  To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise Token.
</Note>

```bash
export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
```
