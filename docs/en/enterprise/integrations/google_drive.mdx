## Overview

Enable your agents to manage files and folders through Google Drive. Upload, download, organize, and share files, create folders, and streamline your document management workflows with AI-powered automation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Google Drive integration, ensure you have:

- A [CrewAI AMP](https://app.crewai.com) account with an active subscription
- A Google account with Google Drive access
- Connected your Google account through the [Integrations page](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)

## Setting Up Google Drive Integration

### 1. Connect Your Google Account
