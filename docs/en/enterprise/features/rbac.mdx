## Overview

RBAC in CrewAI Enterprise enables secure, scalable access management through a combination of organization‑level roles and automation‑level visibility controls.

## Users and Roles

Each member in your CrewAI workspace is assigned a role, which determines their access across various features. 

You can:

- Use predefined roles (Owner, Member)
- Create custom roles tailored to specific permissions
- Assign roles at any time through the settings panel

You can configure users and roles in Settings → Roles.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Roles settings">
    Go to <b>Settings → Roles</b> in CrewAI Enterprise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a role type">
    Use a predefined role (<b>Owner</b>, <b>Member</b>) or click <b>Create role</b> to define a custom one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to members">
    Select users and assign the role. You can change this anytime.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration summary

| Area | Where to configure | Options |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Users & Roles | Settings → Roles | Predefined: Owner, Member; Custom roles |
| Automation visibility | Automation → Settings → Visibility | Private; Whitelist users/roles |

## Automation‑level Access Control

In addition to organization‑wide roles, CrewAI Automations support fine‑grained visibility settings that let you restrict access to specific automations by user or role.

This is useful for:

- Keeping sensitive or experimental automations private
- Managing visibility across large teams or external collaborators
- Testing automations in isolated contexts

Deployments can be configured as private, meaning only whitelisted users and roles will be able to:

- View the deployment
- Run it or interact with its API
- Access its logs, metrics, and settings

The organization owner always has access, regardless of visibility settings.

You can configure automation‑level access control in Automation → Settings → Visibility tab.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Visibility tab">
    Navigate to <b>Automation → Settings → Visibility</b>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set visibility">
    Choose <b>Private</b> to restrict access. The organization owner always retains access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Whitelist access">
    Add specific users and roles allowed to view, run, and access logs/metrics/settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    Save changes, then confirm that non‑whitelisted users cannot view or run the automation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Private visibility: access outcomes

| Action | Owner | Whitelisted user/role | Not whitelisted |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| View automation | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Run automation/API | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Access logs/metrics/settings | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

<Tip>
The organization owner always has access. In private mode, only whitelisted users and roles can view, run, and access logs/metrics/settings.
