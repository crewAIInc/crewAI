### Sample payloads & crews

You can jump-start development with the [HubSpot examples in the trigger repository](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/hubspot):

- `record-created-contact.json`, `record-updated-contact.json` → contact lifecycle events handled by `hubspot-contact-crew.py`
- `record-created-company.json`, `record-updated-company.json` → company enrichment flows in `hubspot-company-crew.py`
- `record-created-deals.json`, `record-updated-deals.json` → deal pipeline automation in `hubspot-record-crew.py`

Each crew demonstrates how to parse HubSpot record fields, enrich context, and return structured insights.

For more detailed information on available actions and customization options, refer to the [HubSpot Workflows Documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/create-workflows).
