## Overview

Automate responses when Outlook delivers a new message or when an event is removed from the calendar. Teams commonly route escalations, file tickets, or alert attendees of cancellations.

<Tip>
  Connect Outlook in **Tools & Integrations** and ensure the trigger is enabled for your deployment.

## Enabling the Outlook Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI Enterprise
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Outlook** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize a new email

```python
from outlook_message_crew import OutlookMessageTrigger

crew = OutlookMessageTrigger().crew()
crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": outlook_payload,
})
```

The crew extracts sender details, subject, body preview, and attachments before generating a structured response.

## Sample payloads & crews

Review the [Outlook examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/outlook) for two common scenarios:

- `new-message.json` → new mail notifications parsed by `outlook-message-crew.py`
- `event-removed.json` → calendar cleanup handled by `outlook-event-removal-crew.py`

Each crew demonstrates how to handle Microsoft Graph payloads, normalize headers, and keep humans in-the-loop with concise summaries.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the Outlook connector is still authorized; the subscription must be renewed periodically
- If attachments are missing, confirm the webhook subscription includes the `includeResourceData` flag
- Review execution logs when events fail to match—cancellation payloads lack attendee lists by design and the crew should account for that
