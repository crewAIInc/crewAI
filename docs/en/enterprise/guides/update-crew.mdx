<Note>
After deploying your crew to CrewAI Enterprise, you may need to make updates to the code, security settings, or configuration. 
This guide explains how to perform these common update operations.
</Note>

## Why Update Your Crew?

CrewAI won't automatically pick up GitHub updates by default, so you'll need to manually trigger updates, unless you checked the `Auto-update` option when deploying your crew.

There are several reasons you might want to update your crew deployment:
- You want to update the code with a latest commit you pushed to GitHub
- You want to reset the bearer token for security reasons
- You want to update environment variables

## 1. Updating Your Crew Code for a Latest Commit

When you've pushed new commits to your GitHub repository and want to update your deployment:

1. Navigate to your crew in the CrewAI Enterprise platform
2. Click on the `Re-deploy` button on your crew details page

<Frame>

</Frame>

This will trigger an update that you can track using the progress bar. The system will pull the latest code from your repository and rebuild your deployment.

## 2. Resetting Bearer Token

If you need to generate a new bearer token (for example, if you suspect the current token might have been compromised):

1. Navigate to your crew in the CrewAI Enterprise platform
2. Find the `Bearer Token` section
3. Click the `Reset` button next to your current token

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Warning>
Resetting your bearer token will invalidate the previous token immediately. Make sure to update any applications or scripts that are using the old token.
</Warning>

## 3. Updating Environment Variables

To update the environment variables for your crew:

1. First access the deployment page by clicking on your crew's name

<Frame>
  ![Environment Variables Button](/images/enterprise/env-vars-button.png)
</Frame>

2. Locate the `Environment Variables` section (you will need to click the `Settings` icon to access it)
3. Edit the existing variables or add new ones in the fields provided
4. Click the `Update` button next to each variable you modify

<Frame>
  ![Update Environment Variables](/images/enterprise/update-env-vars.png)
</Frame>

5. Finally, click the `Update Deployment` button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes

<Note>
Updating environment variables will trigger a new deployment, but this will only update the environment configuration and not the code itself.
</Note>

## After Updating

After performing any update:

1. The system will rebuild and redeploy your crew
2. You can monitor the deployment progress in real-time
3. Once complete, test your crew to ensure the changes are working as expected

<Tip>
If you encounter any issues after updating, you can view deployment logs in the platform or contact support for assistance.
