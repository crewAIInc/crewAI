## Overview

Use the Microsoft Teams trigger to start automations whenever a new chat is created. Common patterns include summarizing inbound requests, routing urgent messages to support teams, or creating follow-up tasks in other systems.

<Tip>
  Confirm Microsoft Teams is connected under **Tools & Integrations** and enabled in the **Triggers** tab for your deployment.
</Tip>

## Enabling the Microsoft Teams Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Microsoft Teams** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize a new chat thread

```python
from teams_chat_created_crew import MicrosoftTeamsChatTrigger

crew = MicrosoftTeamsChatTrigger().crew()
result = crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": teams_payload,
})
print(result.raw)
```

The crew parses thread metadata (subject, created time, roster) and generates an action plan for the receiving team.

## Testing Locally

Test your Microsoft Teams trigger integration locally using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash
# View all available triggers
crewai triggers list

# Simulate a Microsoft Teams trigger with realistic payload
crewai triggers run microsoft_teams/teams_message_created
```

The `crewai triggers run` command will execute your crew with a complete Teams payload, allowing you to test your parsing logic before deployment.

<Warning>
  Use `crewai triggers run microsoft_teams/teams_message_created` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution during development. After deployment, your crew will automatically receive the trigger payload.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Teams connection is active; it must be refreshed if the tenant revokes permissions
- Test locally with `crewai triggers run microsoft_teams/teams_message_created` to see the exact payload structure
- Confirm the webhook subscription in Microsoft 365 is still valid if payloads stop arriving
- Review execution logs for payload shape mismatchesâ€”Graph notifications may omit fields when a chat is private or restricted
- Remember: use `crewai triggers run` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution
