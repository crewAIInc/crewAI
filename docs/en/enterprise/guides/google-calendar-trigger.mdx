## Overview

Use the Google Calendar trigger to launch automations whenever calendar events change. Common use cases include briefing a team before a meeting, notifying stakeholders when a critical event is cancelled, or summarizing daily schedules.

<Tip>
  Make sure Google Calendar is connected in **Tools & Integrations** and enabled
  for the deployment you want to automate.
</Tip>

## Enabling the Google Calendar Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Google Calendar** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize meeting details

The snippet below mirrors the `calendar-event-crew.py` example in the trigger repository. It parses the payload, analyses the attendees and timing, and produces a meeting brief for downstream tools.

```python
from calendar_event_crew import GoogleCalendarEventTrigger

crew = GoogleCalendarEventTrigger().crew()
result = crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": calendar_payload,
})
print(result.raw)
```

Use `crewai_trigger_payload` exactly as it is delivered by the trigger so the crew can extract the proper fields.

## Testing Locally

Test your Google Calendar trigger integration locally using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash
# View all available triggers
crewai triggers list

# Simulate a Google Calendar trigger with realistic payload
crewai triggers run google_calendar/event_changed
```

The `crewai triggers run` command will execute your crew with a complete Calendar payload, allowing you to test your parsing logic before deployment.

<Warning>
  Use `crewai triggers run google_calendar/event_changed` (not `crewai run`) to
  simulate trigger execution during development. After deployment, your crew
  will automatically receive the trigger payload.
</Warning>

## Monitoring Executions

The **Executions** list in the deployment dashboard tracks every triggered run and surfaces payload metadata, output summaries, and errors.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the correct Google account is connected and the trigger is enabled
- Test locally with `crewai triggers run google_calendar/event_changed` to see the exact payload structure
- Confirm your workflow handles all-day events (payloads use `start.date` and `end.date` instead of timestamps)
- Check execution logs if reminders or attendee arrays are missing—calendar permissions can limit fields in the payload
- Remember: use `crewai triggers run` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution
