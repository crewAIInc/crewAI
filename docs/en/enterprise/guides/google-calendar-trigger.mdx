## Overview

Use the Google Calendar trigger to launch automations whenever calendar events change. Common use cases include briefing a team before a meeting, notifying stakeholders when a critical event is cancelled, or summarizing daily schedules.

<Tip>
  Make sure Google Calendar is connected in **Tools & Integrations** and enabled for the deployment you want to automate.

## Enabling the Google Calendar Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI Enterprise
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Google Calendar** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize meeting details

The snippet below mirrors the `calendar-event-crew.py` example in the trigger repository. It parses the payload, analyses the attendees and timing, and produces a meeting brief for downstream tools.

```python
from calendar_event_crew import GoogleCalendarEventTrigger

crew = GoogleCalendarEventTrigger().crew()
result = crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": calendar_payload,
})
print(result.raw)
```

Use `crewai_trigger_payload` exactly as it is delivered by the trigger so the crew can extract the proper fields.

## Sample payloads & crews

The [Google Calendar examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/google_calendar) show how to handle multiple event types:

- `new-event.json` → standard event creation handled by `calendar-event-crew.py`
- `event-updated.json` / `event-started.json` / `event-ended.json` → in-flight updates processed by `calendar-meeting-crew.py`
- `event-canceled.json` → cancellation workflow that alerts attendees via `calendar-meeting-crew.py`
- Working location events use `calendar-working-location-crew.py` to extract on-site schedules

Each crew transforms raw event metadata (attendees, rooms, working locations) into the summaries your teams need.

## Monitoring Executions

The **Executions** list in the deployment dashboard tracks every triggered run and surfaces payload metadata, output summaries, and errors.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the correct Google account is connected and the trigger is enabled
- Confirm your workflow handles all-day events (payloads use `start.date` and `end.date` instead of timestamps)
- Check execution logs if reminders or attendee arrays are missing—calendar permissions can limit fields in the payload
