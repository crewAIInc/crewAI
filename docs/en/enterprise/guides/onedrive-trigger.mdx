## Overview

Start automations when files change inside OneDrive. You can generate audit summaries, notify security teams about external sharing, or update downstream line-of-business systems with new document metadata.

<Tip>
  Connect OneDrive in **Tools & Integrations** and toggle the trigger on for your deployment.
</Tip>

## Enabling the OneDrive Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **OneDrive** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Audit file permissions

```python
from onedrive_file_crew import OneDriveFileTrigger

crew = OneDriveFileTrigger().crew()
crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": onedrive_payload,
})
```

The crew inspects file metadata, user activity, and permission changes to produce a compliance-friendly summary.

## Testing Locally

Test your OneDrive trigger integration locally using the CrewAI CLI:

```bash
# View all available triggers
crewai triggers list

# Simulate a OneDrive trigger with realistic payload
crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed
```

The `crewai triggers run` command will execute your crew with a complete OneDrive payload, allowing you to test your parsing logic before deployment.

<Warning>
  Use `crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution during development. After deployment, your crew will automatically receive the trigger payload.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the connected account has permission to read the file metadata included in the webhook
- Test locally with `crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed` to see the exact payload structure
- If the trigger fires but the payload is missing `permissions`, confirm the site-level sharing settings allow Graph to return this field
- For large tenants, filter notifications upstream so the crew only runs on relevant directories
- Remember: use `crewai triggers run` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution
