## Overview

Trigger your automations when files are created, updated, or removed in Google Drive. Typical workflows include summarizing newly uploaded content, enforcing sharing policies, or notifying owners when critical files change.

<Tip>
  Connect Google Drive in **Tools & Integrations** and confirm the trigger is enabled for the automation you want to monitor.
</Tip>

## Enabling the Google Drive Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Google Drive** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize file activity

The drive example crews parse the payload to extract file metadata, evaluate permissions, and publish a summary.

```python
from drive_file_crew import GoogleDriveFileTrigger

crew = GoogleDriveFileTrigger().crew()
crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": drive_payload,
})
```

## Sample payloads & crews

Explore the [Google Drive examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/google_drive) to cover different operations:

- `new-file.json` → new uploads processed by `drive-file-crew.py`
- `updated-file.json` → file edits and metadata changes handled by `drive-file-crew.py`
- `deleted-file.json` → deletion events routed through `drive-file-deletion-crew.py`

Each crew highlights the file name, operation type, owner, permissions, and security considerations so downstream systems can respond appropriately.

## Monitoring Executions

Track history and performance of triggered runs with the **Executions** list in the deployment dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify Google Drive is connected and the trigger toggle is enabled
- If a payload is missing permission data, ensure the connected account has access to the file or folder
- The trigger sends file IDs only; use the Drive API if you need to fetch binary content during the crew run
