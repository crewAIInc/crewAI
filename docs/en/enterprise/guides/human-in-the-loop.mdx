Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) is a powerful approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to enhance decision-making and improve task outcomes. This guide shows you how to implement HITL within CrewAI.

## Setting Up HITL Workflows

<Steps>
    <Step title="Configure Your Task">
        Set up your task with human input enabled:
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/enterprise/crew-human-input.png" alt="Crew Human Input" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide Webhook URL">
        When kicking off your crew, include a webhook URL for human input:
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/enterprise/crew-webhook-url.png" alt="Crew Webhook URL" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Receive Webhook Notification">
        Once the crew completes the task requiring human input, you'll receive a webhook notification containing:
            - **Execution ID**
            - **Task ID**
            - **Task output**
    </Step>

    <Step title="Review Task Output">
        The system will pause in the `Pending Human Input` state. Review the task output carefully.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Submit Human Feedback">
        Call the resume endpoint of your crew with the following information:
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/enterprise/crew-resume-endpoint.png" alt="Crew Resume Endpoint" />
        </Frame>
        <Warning>
            **Feedback Impact on Task Execution**:
            It's crucial to exercise care when providing feedback, as the entire feedback content will be incorporated as additional context for further task executions.
        </Warning>
        This means:
        - All information in your feedback becomes part of the task's context.
        - Irrelevant details may negatively influence it.
        - Concise, relevant feedback helps maintain task focus and efficiency.
        - Always review your feedback carefully before submission to ensure it contains only pertinent information that will positively guide the task's execution.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle Negative Feedback">
        If you provide negative feedback:
        - The crew will retry the task with added context from your feedback.
        - You'll receive another webhook notification for further review.
        - Repeat steps 4-6 until satisfied.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Execution Continuation">
        When you submit positive feedback, the execution will proceed to the next steps.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable feedback that directly addresses the task at hand
- **Stay Relevant**: Only include information that will help improve the task execution
- **Be Timely**: Respond to HITL prompts promptly to avoid workflow delays
- **Review Carefully**: Double-check your feedback before submitting to ensure accuracy

## Common Use Cases

HITL workflows are particularly valuable for:
- Quality assurance and validation
- Complex decision-making scenarios
- Sensitive or high-stakes operations
- Creative tasks requiring human judgment
- Compliance and regulatory reviews
