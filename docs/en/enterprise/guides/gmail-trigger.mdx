## Overview

Use the Gmail Trigger to kick off your deployed crews when Gmail events happen in connected accounts, such as receiving a new email or messages matching a label/filter.

<Tip>
  Make sure Gmail is connected in Tools & Integrations and the trigger is enabled for your deployment.
</Tip>

## Enabling the Gmail Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI Enterprise
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Gmail** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Process new emails

When a new email arrives, the Gmail Trigger will send the payload to your Crew or Flow. Below is a Crew example that parses and processes the trigger payload.

```python
@CrewBase
class GmailProcessingCrew:
    @agent
    def parser(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['parser'],
        )

    @task
    def parse_gmail_payload(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['parse_gmail_payload'],
            agent=self.parser(),
        )

    @task
    def act_on_email(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['act_on_email'],
            agent=self.parser(),
        )
```

The Gmail payload will be available via the standard context mechanisms. See the payload samples repository for structure and fields.

### Sample payloads & crews

The [CrewAI Enterprise Trigger Examples repository](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/gmail) includes:

- `new-email-payload-1.json` / `new-email-payload-2.json` — production-style new message alerts with matching crews in `new-email-crew.py`
- `thread-updated-sample-1.json` — follow-up messages on an existing thread, processed by `gmail-alert-crew.py`

Use these samples to validate your parsing logic locally before wiring the trigger to your live Gmail accounts.

## Monitoring Executions

Track history and performance of triggered runs:

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Gmail is connected in Tools & Integrations
- Verify the Gmail Trigger is enabled on the Triggers tab
- Check the execution logs and confirm the payload is passed as `crewai_trigger_payload`
