# Installing CrewAI

CrewAI is a flexible and powerful AI framework that enables you to create and manage AI agents, tools, and tasks efficiently. 
Let's get you set up! ðŸš€

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install CrewAI">
        Install CrewAI with all recommended tools using either method:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip install 'crewai[tools]'
        ```
        or
        ```shell Terminal
        pip install crewai crewai-tools
        ```

        <Note>
          Both methods install the core package and additional tools needed for most use cases.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upgrade CrewAI (Existing Installations Only)">
        If you have an older version of CrewAI installed, you can upgrade it:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip install --upgrade crewai crewai-tools
        ```

        <Warning>
            If you see a Poetry-related warning, you'll need to migrate to our new dependency manager:
            ```shell Terminal
            crewai update
            ```
            This will update your project to use [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), our new faster dependency manager.
        </Warning>

        <Note>
            Skip this step if you're doing a fresh installation.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify Installation">
        Check your installed versions:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip freeze | grep crewai
        ```

        You should see something like:
        ```markdown Output
        crewai==X.X.X
        crewai-tools==X.X.X
        ```
        <Check>Installation successful! You're ready to create your first crew.</Check>
    </Step>

# Creating a New Project

<Info>
  We recommend using the YAML Template scaffolding for a structured approach to defining agents and tasks.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Project Structure">
    Run the CrewAI CLI command:
    ```shell Terminal
    crewai create crew <project_name>
    ```

    This creates a new project with the following structure:
    <Frame>
    ```
    my_project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
    â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ .env
    â””â”€â”€ src/
        â””â”€â”€ my_project/
            â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
            â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
            â”œâ”€â”€ crew.py
            â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ custom_tool.py
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
            â””â”€â”€ config/
                â”œâ”€â”€ agents.yaml
                â””â”€â”€ tasks.yaml
    ```
    </Frame>
  </Step>   

  <Step title="Customize Your Project">
    Your project will contain these essential files:

    | File | Purpose |
    | --- | --- |
    | `agents.yaml` | Define your AI agents and their roles |
    | `tasks.yaml` | Set up agent tasks and workflows |
    | `.env` | Store API keys and environment variables |
    | `main.py` | Project entry point and execution flow |
    | `crew.py` | Crew orchestration and coordination |
    | `tools/` | Directory for custom agent tools |

    <Tip>
      Start by editing `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` to define your crew's behavior.
      Keep sensitive information like API keys in `.env`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
