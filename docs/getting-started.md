# Getting Started

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

The example below also uses duckduckgo, so also install that
```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search
```

2. **Setting Up Your Crew**:

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR KEY"

# You can choose to use a local model through Ollama for example. See ./docs/llm-connections.md for more information.
# from langchain.llms import Ollama
# ollama_llm = Ollama(model="openhermes")

# Install duckduckgo-search for this example:
# !pip install -U duckduckgo-search

from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

# Define your agents with roles and goals
researcher = Agent(
  role='Senior Research Analyst',
  goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science',
  backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
  Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
  You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting
  actionable insights.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=False,
  tools=[search_tool]
  # You can pass an optional llm attribute specifying what mode you wanna use.
  # It can be a local model through Ollama / LM Studio or a remote
  # model like OpenAI, Mistral, Antrophic of others (https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/)
  #
  # Examples:
  # llm=ollama_llm # was defined above in the file
  # llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5", temperature=0.7)
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Tech Content Strategist',
  goal='Craft compelling content on tech advancements',
  backstory="""You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for
  your insightful and engaging articles.
  You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True,
  # (optional) llm=ollama_llm
)

# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
  description="""Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024.
  Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts.
  Your final answer MUST be a full analysis report""",
  agent=researcher
)

task2 = Task(
  description="""Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog
  post that highlights the most significant AI advancements.
  Your post should be informative yet accessible, catering to a tech-savvy audience.
  Make it sound cool, avoid complex words so it doesn't sound like AI.
  Your final answer MUST be the full blog post of at least 4 paragraphs.""",
  agent=writer
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, writer],
  tasks=[task1, task2],
  verbose=2, # You can set it to 1 or 2 to different logging levels
)

# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff()

print("######################")
print(result)
```

Currently the only supported process is `Process.sequential`, where one task is executed after the other and the outcome of one is passed as extra content into this next.
