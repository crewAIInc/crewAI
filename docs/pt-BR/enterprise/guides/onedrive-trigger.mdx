## Overview

Start automations when files change inside OneDrive. You can generate audit summaries, notify security teams about external sharing, or update downstream line-of-business systems with new document metadata.

<Tip>
  Connect OneDrive in **Tools & Integrations** and toggle the trigger on for your deployment.

## Enabling the OneDrive Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **OneDrive** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Audit file permissions

```python
from onedrive_file_crew import OneDriveFileTrigger

crew = OneDriveFileTrigger().crew()
crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": onedrive_payload,
})
```

The crew inspects file metadata, user activity, and permission changes to produce a compliance-friendly summary.

## Sample payloads & crews

The [OneDrive examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewai-enterprise-trigger-examples/tree/main/onedrive) showcase how to:

- Parse file metadata, size, and folder paths
- Track who created and last modified the file
- Highlight permission and external sharing changes

`onedrive-file-crew.py` bundles the analysis and summarization tasks so you can add remediation steps as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the connected account has permission to read the file metadata included in the webhook
- If the trigger fires but the payload is missing `permissions`, confirm the site-level sharing settings allow Graph to return this field
- For large tenants, filter notifications upstream so the crew only runs on relevant directories
