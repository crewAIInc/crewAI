## Overview

Trigger your automations when files are created, updated, or removed in Google Drive. Typical workflows include summarizing newly uploaded content, enforcing sharing policies, or notifying owners when critical files change.

<Tip>
  Connect Google Drive in **Tools & Integrations** and confirm the trigger is
  enabled for the automation you want to monitor.
</Tip>

## Enabling the Google Drive Trigger

1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
3. Locate **Google Drive** and switch the toggle to enable

## Example: Summarize file activity

The drive example crews parse the payload to extract file metadata, evaluate permissions, and publish a summary.

```python
from drive_file_crew import GoogleDriveFileTrigger

crew = GoogleDriveFileTrigger().crew()
crew.kickoff({
    "crewai_trigger_payload": drive_payload,
})
```

## Testando Localmente

Teste sua integração de trigger do Google Drive localmente usando a CLI da CrewAI:

```bash
# Visualize todos os triggers disponíveis
crewai triggers list

# Simule um trigger do Google Drive com payload realista
crewai triggers run google_drive/file_changed
```

O comando `crewai triggers run` executará sua crew com um payload completo do Drive, permitindo que você teste sua lógica de parsing antes do deployment.

<Warning>
  Use `crewai triggers run google_drive/file_changed` (não `crewai run`) para
  simular execução de trigger durante o desenvolvimento. Após o deployment, sua
  crew receberá automaticamente o payload do trigger.
</Warning>

## Monitoring Executions

Track history and performance of triggered runs with the **Executions** list in the deployment dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify Google Drive is connected and the trigger toggle is enabled
- Teste localmente com `crewai triggers run google_drive/file_changed` para ver a estrutura exata do payload
- If a payload is missing permission data, ensure the connected account has access to the file or folder
- The trigger sends file IDs only; use the Drive API if you need to fetch binary content during the crew run
- Lembre-se: use `crewai triggers run` (não `crewai run`) para simular execução de trigger
