### 2. Install Integration Tools

All you need is the latest version of `crewai-tools` package.

```bash
uv add crewai-tools
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
<Tip>
  All the services you are authenticated into will be available as tools. So all you need to do is add the `CrewaiEnterpriseTools` to your agent and you are good to go.
</Tip>

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import CrewaiEnterpriseTools

# Get enterprise tools (Gmail tool will be included)
enterprise_tools = CrewaiEnterpriseTools(
    enterprise_token="your_enterprise_token"
)
# print the tools
print(enterprise_tools)

# Create an agent with Gmail capabilities
email_agent = Agent(
    role="Email Manager",
    goal="Manage and organize email communications",
    backstory="An AI assistant specialized in email management and communication.",
    tools=[enterprise_tools]
)

# Task to send an email
email_task = Task(
    description="Draft and send a follow-up email to john@example.com about the project update",
    agent=email_agent,
    expected_output="Confirmation that email was sent successfully"
)

# Run the task
crew = Crew(
    agents=[email_agent],
    tasks=[email_task]
)

# Run the crew
crew.kickoff()
```

### Filtering Tools

```python
from crewai_tools import CrewaiEnterpriseTools

enterprise_tools = CrewaiEnterpriseTools(
    actions_list=["gmail_find_email"] # only gmail_find_email tool will be available
)
gmail_tool = enterprise_tools[0]

gmail_agent = Agent(
    role="Gmail Manager",
    goal="Manage gmail communications and notifications",
    backstory="An AI assistant that helps coordinate gmail communications.",
    tools=[gmail_tool]
)

notification_task = Task(
    description="Find the email from john@example.com",
    agent=gmail_agent,
    expected_output="Email found from john@example.com"
)

# Run the task
crew = Crew(
    agents=[slack_agent],
    tasks=[notification_task]
)
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum permissions required for your agents' tasks
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review connected integrations and their permissions
- **Secure Credentials**: Never hardcode credentials; use CrewAI's secure authentication flow


### Filtering Tools
On a deployed crew, you can specify which actions are avialbel for each integration from the settings page of the service you connected to.

### Scoped Deployments for multi user organizations
You can deploy your crew and scope each integration to a specific user. For example, a crew that connects to google can use a specific user's gmail account.

<Tip>
  This is useful for multi user organizations where you want to scope the integration to a specific user.
</Tip>


Use the `user_bearer_token` to scope the integration to a specific user so that when the crew is kicked off, it will use the user's bearer token to authenticate with the integration. If user is not logged in, then the crew will not use any connected integrations. Use the default bearer token to authenticate with the integrations thats deployed with the crew.
