<Tip>
Crew Studio is a powerful **no-code/low-code** tool that allows you to quickly scaffold or build Crews through a conversational interface. 
</Tip>

## What is Crew Studio?

Crew Studio is an innovative way to create AI agent crews without writing code.

With Crew Studio, you can:

- Chat with the Crew Assistant to describe your problem
- Automatically generate agents and tasks
- Select appropriate tools
- Configure necessary inputs
- Generate downloadable code for customization
- Deploy directly to the CrewAI Enterprise platform

## Configuration Steps

Before you can start using Crew Studio, you need to configure your LLM connections:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up LLM Connection">
    Go to the **LLM Connections** tab in your CrewAI Enterprise dashboard and create a new LLM connection.

    <Note>
      Feel free to use any LLM provider you want that is supported by CrewAI.
    </Note>
    
    Configure your LLM connection:
    
    - Enter a `Connection Name` (e.g., `OpenAI`)
    - Select your model provider: `openai` or `azure`
    - Select models you'd like to use in your Studio-generated Crews
      - We recommend at least `gpt-4o`, `o1-mini`, and `gpt-4o-mini`
    - Add your API key as an environment variable:
      - For OpenAI: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key
      - For Azure OpenAI: Refer to [this article](https://blog.crewai.com/configuring-azure-openai-with-crewai-a-comprehensive-guide/) for configuration details
    - Click `Add Connection` to save your configuration

    - Download the generated code for local customization
    - Deploy the crew directly to the CrewAI Enterprise platform

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Your Crew">
