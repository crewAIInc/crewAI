# Kickoff a Crew on CrewAI Enterprise

Once you've deployed your crew to the CrewAI Enterprise platform, you can kickoff executions through the web interface or the API. This guide covers both approaches.

## Method 1: Using the Web Interface

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Deployed Crew

1. Log in to [CrewAI Enterprise](https://app.crewai.com)
2. Click on the crew name from your projects list
3. You'll be taken to the crew's detail page

</Frame>

### Step 2: Initiate Execution

From your crew's detail page, you have two options to kickoff an execution:

#### Option A: Quick Kickoff

1. Click the `Kickoff` link in the Test Endpoints section
2. Enter the required input parameters for your crew in the JSON editor
3. Click the `Send Request` button

#### Option B: Using the Visual Interface

1. Click the `Run` tab in the crew detail page
2. Enter the required inputs in the form fields
3. Click the `Run Crew` button

</Frame>

### Step 3: Monitor Execution Progress

After initiating the execution:

1. You'll receive a response containing a `kickoff_id` - **copy this ID**
2. This ID is essential for tracking your execution

</Frame>

### Step 4: Check Execution Status

To monitor the progress of your execution:

1. Click the "Status" endpoint in the Test Endpoints section
2. Paste the `kickoff_id` into the designated field
3. Click the "Get Status" button

<Frame>
  ![Get Status](/images/enterprise/get-status.png)
</Frame>

The status response will show:
- Current execution state (`running`, `completed`, etc.)
- Details about which tasks are in progress
- Any outputs produced so far

### Step 5: View Final Results

Once execution is complete:

1. The status will change to `completed`
2. You can view the full execution results and outputs
3. For a more detailed view, check the `Executions` tab in the crew detail page

## Method 2: Using the API

You can also kickoff crews programmatically using the CrewAI Enterprise REST API.

### Authentication

All API requests require a bearer token for authentication:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" https://your-crew-url.crewai.com
```

Your bearer token is available on the Status tab of your crew's detail page.

### Checking Crew Health

Before executing operations, you can verify that your crew is running properly:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" https://your-crew-url.crewai.com
```

A successful response will return a message indicating the crew is operational:

```
Healthy%
```

### Step 1: Retrieve Required Inputs

First, determine what inputs your crew requires:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" \
  https://your-crew-url.crewai.com/inputs
```

The response will be a JSON object containing an array of required input parameters, for example:

```json
{"inputs":["topic","current_year"]}
```

This example shows that this particular crew requires two inputs: `topic` and `current_year`.

### Step 2: Kickoff Execution

Initiate execution by providing the required inputs:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"inputs": {"topic": "AI Agent Frameworks", "current_year": "2025"}}' \
  https://your-crew-url.crewai.com/kickoff
```

The response will include a `kickoff_id` that you'll need for tracking:

```json
{"kickoff_id":"abcd1234-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv"}
```

### Step 3: Check Execution Status

Monitor the execution progress using the kickoff_id:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREW_TOKEN" \
  https://your-crew-url.crewai.com/status/abcd1234-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
```

## Handling Executions

### Long-Running Executions

For executions that may take a long time:

1. Consider implementing a polling mechanism to check status periodically
2. Use webhooks (if available) for notification when execution completes
3. Implement error handling for potential timeouts

### Execution Context

The execution context includes:

- Inputs provided at kickoff
- Environment variables configured during deployment
- Any state maintained between tasks

### Debugging Failed Executions

If an execution fails:

1. Check the "Executions" tab for detailed logs
2. Review the "Traces" tab for step-by-step execution details
3. Look for LLM responses and tool usage in the trace details
