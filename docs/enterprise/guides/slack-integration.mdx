        In the CrewAI dashboard, navigate to the **Integrations** section.

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/enterprise/slack-integration.png" alt="CrewAI Slack Integration" />
        </Frame>

        Verify that Slack is listed and is connected.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open your Slack channel">
        - Navigate to the channel where you want to kickoff the crew.
        - Type the slash command "**/kickoff**" to initiate the crew kickoff process.
        - You should see a  "**Kickoff crew**" appear as you type:

            </Frame>
        - Press Enter or select the "**Kickoff crew**" option. A dialog box titled "**Kickoff an AI Crew**" will appear.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select the crew you want to start">
        - In the dropdown menu labeled "**Select of the crews online:**", choose the crew you want to start.
        - In the example below, "**prep-for-meeting**" is selected:

                <img src="/images/enterprise/kickoff-slack-crew-dropdown.png" alt="Kickoff crew dropdown" />
            </Frame>
        - If your crew requires any inputs, click the "**Add Inputs**" button to provide them.
            <Note>
                The "**Add Inputs**" button is shown in the example above but is not yet clicked.
            </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click Kickoff and wait for the crew to complete">
        - Once you've selected the crew and added any necessary inputs, click "**Kickoff**" to start the crew.
            <Frame>
                <img src="/images/enterprise/kickoff-slack-crew-kickoff.png" alt="Kickoff crew" />
            </Frame>
        - The crew will start executing and you will see the results in the Slack channel.
            <Frame>
                <img src="/images/enterprise/kickoff-slack-crew-results.png" alt="Kickoff crew results" />
            </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to use the `/kickoff` command in your Slack workspace.
- If you don't see your desired crew in the dropdown, ensure it's properly configured and online in CrewAI.
