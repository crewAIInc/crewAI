# Network Activity Monitoring for Tool Execution Verification

## Overview
This enhancement adds network activity monitoring to the existing token-based tool execution verification system in CrewAI. This feature allows the system to detect when tools that claim to make network requests actually do so, versus fabricating responses without making actual network calls.

## Key Components

### 1. NetworkEvent Dataclass
- Captures evidence of network requests during tool execution
- Fields: method, url, timestamp, duration_ms, status_code, bytes_sent, bytes_received, error, headers
- Provides comprehensive information about each network request

### 2. NetworkMonitor Class
- Monitors network activity during tool execution
- Hooks into common HTTP libraries (requests, urllib) using monkey-patching
- Captures network events without breaking existing functionality
- Thread-safe implementation with proper cleanup

### 3. Enhanced ToolExecutionWrapper
- Now includes network monitoring during execution
- Creates NetworkMonitor instance when needed
- Collects network events and adds them to execution records
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. Updated ExecutionRecord
- Now includes network_activity field containing captured NetworkEvents
- Preserves all original functionality while adding network evidence
- Uses field(default_factory=list) to initialize network activity list

### 5. Enhanced complete_execution Method
- Updated to accept network_events parameter
- Stores network evidence with execution records
- Maintains original functionality for non-network operations

## Network Detection Capabilities

The system detects network activity for:
- HTTP/HTTPS requests via the `requests` library
- HTTP/HTTPS requests via the `urllib` library
- Request method, URL, status codes, timing, and data transfer amounts
- Error conditions during network requests

## Verification Logic

### For Fake Tools (No Network Activity):
- Tool executes but makes no network requests
- Network activity list remains empty
- System can identify this as likely fabrication

### For Real Tools (Network Activity):  
- Tool executes and makes actual network requests
- Network events are captured and stored
- System can verify actual network activity occurred

## Integration Benefits

1. **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Non-Breaking**: Uses wrapper pattern for integration
3. **Comprehensive**: Works with common HTTP libraries
4. **Thread-Safe**: Handles concurrent tool execution
5. **Evidence-Based**: Provides clear evidence for verification decisions

## Usage Example

```python
from crewai.utilities.tool_execution_verifier import AgentExecutionInterface, ToolExecutionWrapper, execution_registry

# Create agent interface
agent = AgentExecutionInterface("verification_agent")

# Create and wrap your tool
def fake_tool(url: str) -> str:
    return f"Fabricated content from {url}"

wrapper = ToolExecutionWrapper(fake_tool, "FakeTool")

# Request execution token
token = agent.request_tool_execution("FakeTool", "task1", "https://example.com")

# Execute with verification
result = wrapper.execute_with_token(token, "https://example.com")

# Check verification results
record = execution_registry.verify_token(token.token_id)
if len(record.network_activity) == 0:
    print("Likely fake - no network activity detected")
else:
    print(f"Network activity detected: {len(record.network_activity)} requests")
```

## Verification Criteria

- **LIKELY_REAL**: Network activity detected during tool execution
- **LIKELY_FAKE**: No network activity detected when network calls were expected
- **UNCERTAIN**: Network activity doesn't match expected patterns

This enhancement significantly improves the ability to detect AI fabrication of tool results while maintaining CrewAI's existing functionality.
