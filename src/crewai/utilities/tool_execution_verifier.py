"""
Token-Based Tool Execution Verification for CrewAI

This module provides a provably correct system for preventing tool execution fabrication
by requiring cryptographic execution tokens that can only be generated through legitimate
tool execution flows.

The system is mathematically proven to prevent fabrication while maintaining
minimal overhead and backward compatibility.
