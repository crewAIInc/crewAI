# CodeInterpreterTool

## Description
This tool is used to give the Agent the ability to run code (Python3) from the code generated by the Agent itself. The code is executed in a sandboxed environment, so it is safe to run any code.

## Requirements

- Docker

## Installation
Install the crewai_tools package
```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Remember that when using this tool, the code must be generated by the Agent itself. The code must be a Python3 code. And it will take some time for the first time to run because it needs to build the Docker image.

```python
from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

Agent(
    ...
    tools=[CodeInterpreterTool()],
)
```
