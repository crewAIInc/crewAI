    This tool inherits its schema handling from BaseTool to avoid recursive schema
    definition issues. The args_schema is set to FileReadToolSchema which defines
    the required file_path parameter. The schema should not be overridden in the
    constructor as it would break the inheritance chain and cause infinite loops.

    The tool supports two ways of specifying the file path:
    1. At construction time via the file_path parameter
    2. At runtime via the file_path parameter in the tool's input

    Args:
        file_path (Optional[str]): Path to the file to be read. If provided,
            this becomes the default file path for the tool.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to BaseTool.

    Example:
        >>> tool = FileReadTool(file_path="/path/to/file.txt")
        >>> content = tool.run()  # Reads /path/to/file.txt
        >>> content = tool.run(file_path="/path/to/other.txt")  # Reads other.txt
