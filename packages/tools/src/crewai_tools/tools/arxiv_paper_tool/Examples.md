### Example 1: Fetching Research Papers from arXiv with CrewAI

This example demonstrates how to build a simple CrewAI workflow that automatically searches for and downloads academic papers from [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org). The setup uses:

* A custom `ArxivPaperTool` to fetch metadata and download PDFs
* A single `Agent` tasked with locating relevant papers based on a given research topic
* A `Task` to define the data retrieval and download process
* A sequential `Crew` to orchestrate execution

The downloaded PDFs are saved to a local directory (`./DOWNLOADS`). Filenames are optionally based on sanitized paper titles, ensuring compatibility with your operating system.

> The saved PDFs can be further used in **downstream tasks**, such as:
>
> * **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
> * **Summarization**
> * **Citation extraction**
> * **Embedding-based search or analysis**
