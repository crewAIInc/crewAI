      ''The impact of AI in the future of work'' a 4 out of 5. The title is clear,
      relevant, and appealing as it addresses a highly topical subject with significant
      interest in both the academic and professional communities. It implies a forward-looking
      analysis which can attract various stakeholders interested in the future trends
      of employment, technology, and society. The only improvement could be to make
      it slightly more specific or engaging to ensure maximum impact."}], "model":
