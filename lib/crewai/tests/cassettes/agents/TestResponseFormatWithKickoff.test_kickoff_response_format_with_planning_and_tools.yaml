        at text-based responses, the recent change is their expanding capacity to
        act, using tools, calling[APIs], coordinating with other systems and completing
        tasks independently.\\nThis shift did not happen overnight. A key inflection
        point came in late 2024, when Anthropic released the[Model Context Protocol].
        The protocol allowed developers to connect large language models to external
        tools in a standardized way, effectively giving models the ability to act
        beyond generating text. With that, the stage was set for 2025 to become the
        year of AI agents.\\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \\nAI agents are a whole
        new ballgame compared with generative AI.## The milestones that defined 2025\\nThe
        momentum accelerated quickly. In January, the release of Chinese model[DeepSeek-R1]
        as an[open-weight] model disrupted assumptions about who could build high-performing
        large language models, briefly rattling markets and intensifying global competition.
        An open-weight model is an AI model whose training, reflected in values called
        weights, is publicly available. Throughout 2025, major U.S. labs such as[OpenAI],[Anthropic],[Google]
        and[xAI] released larger, high-performance models, while Chinese tech companies
        including[Alibaba],[Tencent], and[DeepSeek] expanded the open-model ecosystem
        to the point where the Chinese models have been[downloaded more than American
        models].\\n##### Another turning point came in April, when Google introduced
        its[Agent2Agent protocol]. While Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol focused
        on how agents use tools, Agent2Agent addressed how agents communicate with
        each other. Crucially, the two protocols were designed to work together. Later
        in the year, both[Anthropic] and[Google] donated their protocols to the open-source
        software nonprofit Linux Foundation, cementing them as open standards rather
        than proprietary experiments.\\nThese developments quickly found their way
        into consumer products. By mid-2025, \u201Cagentic browsers\u201D began to
        appear. Tools such as[Perplexity\u2019s Comet],[Browser Company\u2019s Dia],[OpenAI\u2019s
        GPT Atlas],[Copilot in Microsoft\u2019s Edge],[ASI X Inc.\u2019s Fellou],[MainFunc.ai\u2019s
        Genspark],[Opera\u2019s Opera Neon] and others reframed the browser as an
        active participant rather than a passive interface. For example, rather than
        helping you search for vacation details, it plays a part in booking the vacation.\\nAt
        the same time, workflow builders like[n8n] and[Google\u2019s Antigravity]
        lowered the technical barrier for creating custom agent systems beyond what
        has already happened with coding agents like[Cursor] and[GitHub Copilot].\\n##
        New power, new risks\\nAs agents became more capable, their risks became harder
        to ignore. In November, Anthropic disclosed how its Claude Code agent[had
        been misused] to automate parts of a cyberattack. The incident illustrated
        a broader concern: By automating repetitive, technical work, AI agents can
        also lower the barrier for malicious activity.\\nThis tension defined much
        of 2025. AI agents expanded what individuals and organizations could do, but
        they also[amplified existing vulnerabilities]. Systems that were once isolated
        text generators became interconnected, tool-using actors operating with little
        human oversight.\\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \\nThe business community is
        gearing up for multiagent systems.## What to watch for in 2026\\nLooking ahead,
        several open questions are likely to shape the next phase of AI agents.\\nOne
        is benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks, which are like a structured exam with
        a series of questions and standardized scoring, work well for single models,
        but[agents are composite systems] made up of models, tools, memory and decision
        logic. Researchers increasingly want to evaluate[not just outcomes, but processes].
        This would be like asking students to show their work, not just provide an
        answer.\\nProgress here will be critical for improving reliability and trust,
        and ensuring that an AI agent will perform the task at hand. One method is
        establishing clear definitions around[AI agents and AI workflows]. Organizations
        will need to map out exactly where AI will[integrate into workflows or introduce
        new ones].\\nAnother development to watch is governance. In late 2025, the
        Linux Foundation announced the creation of the[Agentic AI Foundation], signaling
        an effort to establish shared standards and best practices. If successful,
        it could play a role like the[World Wide Web Consortium] in shaping an open,
        interoperable agent ecosystem.\\nThere is also a growing debate over model
        size. While large, general-purpose models dominate headlines, smaller and
        more specialized models are often[better suited to specific tasks]. As agents
        become configurable consumer and business tools, whether through browsers
        or workflow management software, the power to choose the right model increasingly
        shifts to users rather than labs or corporations.\\n## The challenges ahead\\nDespite
        the optimism, significant socio-technical challenges remain. Expanding data
        center infrastructure[strains energy grids] and affects local communities.
        In workplaces, agents raise concerns about automation,[job displacement] and
        surveillance.\\nFrom a security perspective, connecting models to tools and
        stacking agents together[multiplies risks] that are already unresolved in
        standalone large language models. Specifically, AI practitioners are addressing
        the dangers of[indirect prompt injections], where prompts are hidden in open
        web spaces that are readable by AI agents and result in harmful or unintended
        actions.\\nRegulation is another unresolved issue. Compared with[Europe] and[China],
        the United States has relatively limited oversight of algorithmic systems.
        As AI agents become embedded across digital life, questions about access,
        accountability and limits remain largely unanswered.\\nMeeting these challenges
        will require more than technical breakthroughs. It demands[rigorous engineering
        practices], careful design and clear documentation of how systems work and
        fail. Only by treating AI agents as socio-technical systems rather than mere
        software components, I believe, can we build an AI ecosystem that is both
        innovative and safe.\\n**\\n* [Artificial intelligence (AI)] \\n* [Google]

        This Article\\n![Illustration of an autonomous AI agent symbolizing the advancements
        and potential of AI agents in 2025.] ## Introduction\\nAccording to recent
        research, the global autonomous AI agents market is projected to reach[$9.9
        billion in 2025] and is anticipated to grow significantly to[$253.3 billion
        by 2034], registering a strong CAGR of43.4%during the forecast period. This
        explosive growth is driven by rapid enterprise adoption, continuous advancements
        in artificial intelligence, and the expansion of automation across diverse
        industries. North America is expected to command the largest market share
        in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global market.\\nThis comprehensive guide
        explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals, applications, and 2025
        developments, providing essential insights for businesses, developers, and
        decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are Autonomous AI
        Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents are self-governing
        systems that operate independently without constant human intervention, making
        decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals using machine learning
        and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents] represent a significant
        leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence
        that requires explicit programming for every scenario, autonomous agents possess
        the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent decisions based on their
        environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine learning], natural
        language processing, and real-time data analysis to create intelligent entities
        that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For example:**Learners
        today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform], which uses these
        same principles to personalize instruction, track progress, and respond dynamically
        to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents behave in complex
        business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their autonomy \u2013the
        ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions,
        and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This independence
        makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate complex
        processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
        delivery around the clock.\\n#####\",\"image\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Are-Autonomous-AI-Agents-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025.webp\",\"favicon\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-05-2-150x150.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/blog/ai-agent-in-2025-how-autonomous-agents-are-redefining-workflows\",\"title\":\"AI

        They\u2019ve moved far beyond experimental use.\\nToday, AI-powered agents
        handle critical business tasks, manage data, and automate complex workflows.
        What was once a futuristic idea is now a practical reality. Autonomous AI

        are setting new standards for efficiency.\\nLet\u2019s dive into why AI agent
        use cases are becoming central to modern business operations.\\n## Why Businesses
        Can\u2019t Ignore AI Agents Anymore\\nThe simple answer: efficiency. AI agents
        streamline repetitive tasks that consume time and resources.\\nMistakes in
        manual processes can be costly. AI-powered agents complete tasks with consistent
        accuracy. Scalability is another driver. Humans can multitask, but autonomous
        AI agents handle hundreds of tasks simultaneously.\\nThis power enables rapid
        growth, particularly in industries such as healthcare,[finance], and e-commerce.\\nMore
        importantly, automation frees employees from routine work. With AI workflow
        automation, they focus on creativity and strategy.\\nThe benefits are clear:
        better results, reduced costs, and faster operations. Businesses can\u2019t
        afford to ignore them.\\n## AI Agents Explained: What They Really Do in 2025\\nSo,
        what exactly is an AI agent? At its core, it\u2019s a digital decision-maker.\\nUnlike
        traditional bots, autonomous AI agents don\u2019t just follow commands. They
        learn, adapt, and improve. They integrate with systems like[CRM] s, ERPs,
        and analytics platforms. This makes AI workflow automation seamless.\\nFor
        instance, a customer service AI agent can analyze past cases and resolve issues
        faster.\\nIn finance, AI-powered agents detect fraud by spotting unusual transaction
        patterns in real-time.\\nSome popular AI agent use cases include HR onboarding,
        lead qualification, inventory monitoring, and IT helpdesk support.\\nWherever
        there\u2019s repetitive, data-heavy work, autonomous AI agents are stepping
        in.\\n## What\u2019s New with Autonomous AI Agents in 2025\\nSeveral advancements
        are expected to enhance the capabilities of AI agents in 2025.\\nFirst, natural
        language capabilities have evolved. Teams interact with AI-powered agents
        using plain English commands.\\nSecond, cross-platform integration is seamless.
        Autonomous AI agents seamlessly integrate CRMs, ERPs, and communication apps.
        For example, an AI agent can fetch customer data, update invoices, and send
        email alerts instantly.\\nThird, compliance and security features have matured.
        Companies trust the best AI agent tools with sensitive data.\\nFourth, predictive
        insights are now standard. AI agents forecast outcomes and suggest smarter
        actions.\\nFinally, the user experience has improved dramatically. Drag-and-drop
        builders simplify the design of AI workflow automation.\\nTogether, these
        innovations make autonomous AI agents indispensable\",\"image\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blog-Banner-for-Rolustech-26.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Vector-5.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://medium.com/@Micheal-Lanham/building-the-future-your-guide-to-autonomous-ai-agents-in-2025-fb690ebc1caa\",\"title\":\"Building

        advancements in reasoning and memory, AI models are now more capable and efficient,
        and we\u2019re seeing how AI systems can help us all solve problems in new
        ways.\\nFor example, 15 million developersare already using GitHub Copilot,
        and features like agent mode andcode revieware streamlining the way they code,
        check, deploy and troubleshoot.\\nHundreds of thousands of customers are using[Microsoft
        365 Copilot] to help research, brainstorm and develop solutions, and more
        than 230,000 organizations \u2014including 90% of the Fortune 500 \u2014have
        already used Copilot Studio to build AI agents and automations.\\nCompanies
        like[Fujitsu] and[NTT DATA] are using Azure AI Foundry to build and manage
        AI apps and agents that help prioritize sales leads, speed proposal creation
        and surface client insights. Stanford Health Care is using Microsoft\u2019s
        healthcare agent orchestrator[to build and test AI agents] that can help alleviate
        the administrative burden and speed up the workflow for tumor board preparation.\\nDevelopers
        are at the center of it all. For 50 years Microsoft has been empowering developers
        with tools and platforms to turn their ideas into reality, accelerating innovation
        at every stage. From AI-driven automation to seamless cloud integration and
        more, it\u2019s exciting to see how developers are fueling the next generation
        of digital transformation.\\nSo, what\u2019s next?\\nWe envision a world in
        which agents operate across individual, organizational, team and end-to-end
        business contexts. This emerging vision of the internet**is an open agentic
        web**, where AI agents make decisions and perform tasks on behalf of users
        or organizations.\\nAt Microsoft Build we\u2019re showing the steps we\u2019re
        taking to make this vision a reality through our platforms, products and infrastructure.
        We\u2019re putting new models and coding agents in the hands of developers,

        PDF] [HTML (experimental)] > > Abstract:\\n> The emergence of agentic reinforcement
        learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement
        learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive
        sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex,
        dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting
        the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with
        the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)
        that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive
        twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including
        planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and
        the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to
        our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism
        for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive,
        robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate
        the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into
        a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
        survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
        opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
        general-purpose AI agents. Comments:|Published on Transactions on Machine

        > > Abstract:\\n> Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning
        in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches
        train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls
        under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools
        and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
        alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
        training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics
        of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
        agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
        generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
        the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based
        Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon,
        sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into
        a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single,
        verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions
        with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages.
        Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing
        baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic,
        14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger
        proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow
        optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability,
        and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns. Comments:|45 pages,

        [HTML (experimental)] > > Abstract:\\n> Equipping large language models (LLMs)
        with complex, interleaved reasoning and tool-use capabilities has become a
        key focus in agentic AI research, especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented
        (``thinking&#39;&#39;) models. Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number
        of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which
        requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this
        paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models
        for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike
        multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what
        to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines
        its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While
        prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs,
        we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models
        to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards
        this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which
        we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves
        up to 28.7% on Humanity&#39;s Last Exam benchmark. In addition, we conduct
        key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.

        use powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered
        by evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial
        agents typically learn using handcrafted learning rules. Despite decades of
        interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has
        proven to be elusive[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. Here we show that it is possible
        for machines to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually
        designed rules. This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences
        of a population of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically,
        our method discovers the RL rule by which the agent\u2019s policy and predictions
        are updated. In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed
        all existing rules on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed
        a number of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that
        it had not seen during discovery. Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms
        required for advanced artificial intelligence may soon be automatically discovered
        from the experiences of agents, rather than manually designed.\\n### Similar

        Main\\nThe primary goal of artificial intelligence is to design agents that,
        like humans, can predict and act in complex environments to achieve goals.
        Many of the most successful agents are based on reinforcement learning (RL),
        in which agents learn by interacting with environments. Decades of research
        have produced ever more efficient RL algorithms, resulting in numerous landmarks
        in artificial intelligence, including the mastery of complex competitive games
        such as Go[7], chess[8],*StarCraft*[9] and*Minecraft*[10], the invention of
        new mathematical tools[11], or the control of complex physical systems[12].\\nUnlike
        humans, whose learning mechanism has been naturally discovered by biological
        evolution, RL algorithms are typically manually designed. This is usually
        slow and laborious, and limited by reliance on human knowledge and intuition.
        Although a number of attempts have been made to automatically discover learning
        algorithms[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6], none have proven to be sufficiently efficient
        and general to replace hand-designed RL systems.\\nIn this work, we introduce
        an autonomous method for discovering RL rules solely through the experience
        of many generations of agents interacting with various environments (Fig.[1a]).
        The discovered RL rule achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety
        of challenging RL benchmarks. The success of our method contrasts previous
        work in two dimensions. First, whereas previous methods searched over narrow
        spaces of RL rules (for example, hyperparameters[13],[14] or policy loss[1],[6]),
        our method allows the agent to explore a far more expressive space of potential
        RL rules. Second, whereas previous work focused on meta-learning in simple
        environments (for example, grid-worlds[3],[15]), our method meta-learns in
        complex and diverse environments at a much larger scale.\\n**Fig. 1: Discovering
        an RL rule from a population of agents.**\\n[![figure 1]] \\n**a**, Discovery.
        Multiple agents, interacting with various environments, are trained in parallel
        according to the learning rule, defined by the meta-network. In the meantime,
        the meta-network is optimized to improve the agents\u2019 collective performances.**b**,
        Agent architecture. An agent produces the following outputs: (1) a policy(**\u03C0**),
        (2) an observation-conditioned prediction vector(**y**), (3) action-conditioned
        prediction vectors(**z**), (4) action values(**q**) and (5) an auxiliary policy
        prediction(**p**). The semantics of**y**and**z**are determined by the meta-network.**c**,
        Meta-network architecture. A trajectory of the agent\u2019s outputs is given
        as input to the meta-network, together with rewards and episode termination
        indicators from the environment (omitted for simplicity in the figure). Using
        this information, the meta-network produces targets for all of the agent\u2019s
        predictions from the current and future time steps. The agent is updated to
        minimize the prediction errors with respect to their targets. LSTM, long short-term
        memory.**d**, Meta-optimization. The meta-parameters of the meta-network are
        updated by taking a meta-gradient step calculated from backpropagation through
        the agent\u2019s update process (*\u03B8*0\u2192*\u03B8**N*), where the meta-objective
        isto maximize the collective returns of the agents in their environments.\\n[Full
        size image] \\nTo choose a general space of discovery, we observe that the
        essential component of standard RL algorithms is a rule that updates one or
        more predictions, as well as the policy itself, towards targets that are functions
        of quantities such as future rewards and future predictions. Examples of RL
        rules based on different targets include temporal-difference learning[16],*Q*-learning[17],
        proximal policy optimization (PPO)[18], auxiliary tasks[19], successor features[20]
        and distributional RL[21]. In each case, the choice of target determines the
        nature of the predictions, for example, whether they become value functions,
        models or successor features.\\nIn our framework, an RL rule is represented
        by a meta-network that determines the targets towards which the agent should
        move its predictions and policy (Fig.[1c]). This allows the system to discover
        useful predictions without pre-defined semantics, as well as how they are
        used. The system may in principle rediscover past RL rules, but the flexible
        functional form also allows the agent to invent new RL rules that may be specifically
        adapted to environments of interest.\\nDuring the discovery process, we instantiate
        a population of agents, each of which interacts with its own instance of an
        environment taken from a diverse set of challenging tasks. Each agent\u2019s
        parameters are updated according to the current RL rule. We then use the meta-gradient
        method[13] to incrementally improve the RL rule such that it could lead to
        better-performing agents.\\nOur large-scale empirical results show that our
        discovered RL rule, which we call DiscoRL, surpasses all existing RL rules
        on the environments in which it was meta-learned. Notably, this includes Atari
        games[22], arguably the most established and informative of RL benchmarks.
        Furthermore, DiscoRL achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of
        other challenging benchmarks, such as ProcGen[23], that it had never been
        exposed to during discovery. We also show that the performance and generality

        > > Abstract:\\n> This technical brief introduces Deep Agent, an advanced
        autonomous AI system designed to manage complex multi-phase tasks through
        a novel hierarchical task management architecture. The system&#39;s foundation
        is built on our Hierarchical Task DAG (HTDAG) framework, which dynamically
        decomposes high-level objectives into manageable sub-tasks while rigorously
        maintaining dependencies and execution coherence. Deep Agent advances beyond
        traditional agent systems through three key innovations: First, it implements
        a recursive two-stage planner-executor architecture that enables continuous
        task refinement and adaptation as circumstances change. Second, it features
        an Autonomous API &amp; Tool Creation (AATC) system that automatically generates
        reusable components from UI interactions, substantially reducing operational
        costs for similar tasks. Third, it incorporates Prompt Tweaking Engine and
        Autonomous Prompt Feedback Learning components that optimize Large Language
        Model prompts for specific scenarios, enhancing both inference accuracy and
        operational stability. These components are integrated to form a service infrastructure
        that manages user contexts, handles complex task dependencies, and orchestrates
        end-to-end agentic workflow execution. Through this sophisticated architecture,
        Deep Agent establishes a novel paradigm in self-governing AI systems, demonstrating
        robust capability to independently handle intricate, multi-step tasks while
        maintaining consistent efficiency and reliability through continuous self-optimization.

      [WhatsApp] [Messenger] [LinkedIn] [X (Twitter)] \\nPrint article\\nIn artificial
      intelligence, 2025 marked a decisive shift. Systems once confined to research
      labs and prototypes began to appear as everyday tools. At the center of this
      transition was the rise of AI agents \u2013AI systems that can use other software
      tools and act on their own.\\nWhile researchers have studied AI for more than
      60 years, and the term \u201Cagent\u201D has long been part of the field\u2019s
      vocabulary, 2025 was the year the concept became concrete for developers and
      consumers alike.\\nAI agents moved from theory to infrastructure, reshaping
      how people interact with large language models, the systems that power chatbots
      like ChatGPT.\\nIn 2025, the definition of AI agent shifted from the[academic
      framing] of systems that perceive, reason and act to AI company[Anthropic\u2019s
      description] of large language models that are capable of using software tools
      and taking autonomous action. While large language models have long excelled
      at text-based responses, the recent change is their expanding capacity to act,
      using tools, calling[APIs], coordinating with other systems and completing tasks
      independently.\\nThis shift did not happen overnight. A key inflection point
      came in late 2024, when Anthropic released the[Model Context Protocol]. The
      protocol allowed developers to connect large language models to external tools
      in a standardized way, effectively giving models the ability to act beyond generating
      text. With that, the stage was set for 2025 to become the year of AI agents.\\n[![Embedded
      YouTube video]] \\nAI agents are a whole new ballgame compared with generative
      AI.## The milestones that defined 2025\\nThe momentum accelerated quickly. In
      January, the release of Chinese model[DeepSeek-R1] as an[open-weight] model
      disrupted assumptions about who could build high-performing large language models,
      briefly rattling markets and intensifying global competition. An open-weight
      model is an AI model whose training, reflected in values called weights, is
      publicly available. Throughout 2025, major U.S. labs such as[OpenAI],[Anthropic],[Google]
      and[xAI] released larger, high-performance models, while Chinese tech companies
      including[Alibaba],[Tencent], and[DeepSeek] expanded the open-model ecosystem
      to the point where the Chinese models have been[downloaded more than American
      models].\\n##### Another turning point came in April, when Google introduced
      its[Agent2Agent protocol]. While Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol focused
      on how agents use tools, Agent2Agent addressed how agents communicate with each
      other. Crucially, the two protocols were designed to work together. Later in
      the year, both[Anthropic] and[Google] donated their protocols to the open-source
      software nonprofit Linux Foundation, cementing them as open standards rather
      than proprietary experiments.\\nThese developments quickly found their way into
      consumer products. By mid-2025, \u201Cagentic browsers\u201D began to appear.
      Tools such as[Perplexity\u2019s Comet],[Browser Company\u2019s Dia],[OpenAI\u2019s
      GPT Atlas],[Copilot in Microsoft\u2019s Edge],[ASI X Inc.\u2019s Fellou],[MainFunc.ai\u2019s
      Genspark],[Opera\u2019s Opera Neon] and others reframed the browser as an active
      participant rather than a passive interface. For example, rather than helping
      you search for vacation details, it plays a part in booking the vacation.\\nAt
      the same time, workflow builders like[n8n] and[Google\u2019s Antigravity] lowered
      the technical barrier for creating custom agent systems beyond what has already
      happened with coding agents like[Cursor] and[GitHub Copilot].\\n## New power,
      new risks\\nAs agents became more capable, their risks became harder to ignore.
      In November, Anthropic disclosed how its Claude Code agent[had been misused]
      to automate parts of a cyberattack. The incident illustrated a broader concern:
      By automating repetitive, technical work, AI agents can also lower the barrier
      for malicious activity.\\nThis tension defined much of 2025. AI agents expanded
      what individuals and organizations could do, but they also[amplified existing
      vulnerabilities]. Systems that were once isolated text generators became interconnected,
      tool-using actors operating with little human oversight.\\n[![Embedded YouTube
      video]] \\nThe business community is gearing up for multiagent systems.## What
      to watch for in 2026\\nLooking ahead, several open questions are likely to shape
      the next phase of AI agents.\\nOne is benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks, which
      are like a structured exam with a series of questions and standardized scoring,
      work well for single models, but[agents are composite systems] made up of models,
      tools, memory and decision logic. Researchers increasingly want to evaluate[not
      just outcomes, but processes]. This would be like asking students to show their
      work, not just provide an answer.\\nProgress here will be critical for improving
      reliability and trust, and ensuring that an AI agent will perform the task at
      hand. One method is establishing clear definitions around[AI agents and AI workflows].
      Organizations will need to map out exactly where AI will[integrate into workflows
      or introduce new ones].\\nAnother development to watch is governance. In late
      2025, the Linux Foundation announced the creation of the[Agentic AI Foundation],
      signaling an effort to establish shared standards and best practices. If successful,
      it could play a role like the[World Wide Web Consortium] in shaping an open,
      interoperable agent ecosystem.\\nThere is also a growing debate over model size.
      While large, general-purpose models dominate headlines, smaller and more specialized
      models are often[better suited to specific tasks]. As agents become configurable
      consumer and business tools, whether through browsers or workflow management
      software, the power to choose the right model increasingly shifts to users rather
      than labs or corporations.\\n## The challenges ahead\\nDespite the optimism,
      significant socio-technical challenges remain. Expanding data center infrastructure[strains
      energy grids] and affects local communities. In workplaces, agents raise concerns
      about automation,[job displacement] and surveillance.\\nFrom a security perspective,
      connecting models to tools and stacking agents together[multiplies risks] that
      are already unresolved in standalone large language models. Specifically, AI
      practitioners are addressing the dangers of[indirect prompt injections], where
      prompts are hidden in open web spaces that are readable by AI agents and result
      in harmful or unintended actions.\\nRegulation is another unresolved issue.
      Compared with[Europe] and[China], the United States has relatively limited oversight
      of algorithmic systems. As AI agents become embedded across digital life, questions
      about access, accountability and limits remain largely unanswered.\\nMeeting
      these challenges will require more than technical breakthroughs. It demands[rigorous
      engineering practices], careful design and clear documentation of how systems
      work and fail. Only by treating AI agents as socio-technical systems rather
      than mere software components, I believe, can we build an AI ecosystem that
      is both innovative and safe.\\n**\\n* [Artificial intelligence (AI)] \\n* [Google]

      applications, and 2025 developments, providing essential insights for businesses,
      developers, and decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are
      Autonomous AI Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents
      are self-governing systems that operate independently without constant human
      intervention, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals
      using machine learning and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents]
      represent a significant leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional
      artificial intelligence that requires explicit programming for every scenario,
      autonomous agents possess the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent
      decisions based on their environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine
      learning], natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to create
      intelligent entities that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For
      example:**Learners today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform],
      which uses these same principles to personalize instruction, track progress,
      and respond dynamically to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents
      behave in complex business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their
      autonomy \u2013the ability to perceive their environment, process information,
      make decisions, and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This
      independence makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate
      complex processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
      delivery around the clock.\\n#####\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: AI Agent in

      \\nWe\u2019ve entered the era of AI agents. Thanks to groundbreaking advancements
      in reasoning and memory, AI models are now more capable and efficient, and we\u2019re
      seeing how AI systems can help us all solve problems in new ways.\\nFor example,
      15 million developersare already using GitHub Copilot, and features like agent
      mode andcode revieware streamlining the way they code, check, deploy and troubleshoot.\\nHundreds
      of thousands of customers are using[Microsoft 365 Copilot] to help research,
      brainstorm and develop solutions, and more than 230,000 organizations \u2014including
      90% of the Fortune 500 \u2014have already used Copilot Studio to build AI agents
      and automations.\\nCompanies like[Fujitsu] and[NTT DATA] are using Azure AI
      Foundry to build and manage AI apps and agents that help prioritize sales leads,
      speed proposal creation and surface client insights. Stanford Health Care is
      using Microsoft\u2019s healthcare agent orchestrator[to build and test AI agents]
      that can help alleviate the administrative burden and speed up the workflow

      Abstract:\\n> The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks
      a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language
      models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
      decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes
      this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision
      Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable
      Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this
      foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around
      core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning,
      self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across
      diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves
      as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic
      modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future
      research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks,
      and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred
      recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field
      and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development
      of scalable, general-purpose AI agents. Comments:|Published on Transactions

      reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs),
      but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that
      interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with
      long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic
      systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized
      modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled
      from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a
      trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner,
      executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes
      its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments,
      we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
      long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization
      into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single,
      verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions
      with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages.
      Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing
      baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic,
      14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger
      proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow
      optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability,
      and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns. Comments:|45 pages,

      Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning and
      tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research, especially
      with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking&#39;&#39;) models. Such
      capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One such
      application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning
      over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native
      Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python
      tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined
      roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous
      single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without
      manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or
      instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of
      reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving
      reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely
      synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant
      SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity&#39;s Last Exam benchmark. In addition,
      we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.

      powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered by
      evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial
      agents typically learn using handcrafted learning rules. Despite decades of
      interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has proven
      to be elusive[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. Here we show that it is possible for machines
      to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually designed rules.
      This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences of a population
      of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically, our method
      discovers the RL rule by which the agent\u2019s policy and predictions are updated.
      In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed all existing rules
      on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed a number of state-of-the-art
      RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that it had not seen during discovery.
      Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms required for advanced artificial
      intelligence may soon be automatically discovered from the experiences of agents,
      rather than manually designed.\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n![]

      December 2025\\n## Main\\nThe primary goal of artificial intelligence is to
      design agents that, like humans, can predict and act in complex environments
      to achieve goals. Many of the most successful agents are based on reinforcement
      learning (RL), in which agents learn by interacting with environments. Decades
      of research have produced ever more efficient RL algorithms, resulting in numerous
      landmarks in artificial intelligence, including the mastery of complex competitive
      games such as Go[7], chess[8],*StarCraft*[9] and*Minecraft*[10], the invention
      of new mathematical tools[11], or the control of complex physical systems[12].\\nUnlike
      humans, whose learning mechanism has been naturally discovered by biological
      evolution, RL algorithms are typically manually designed. This is usually slow
      and laborious, and limited by reliance on human knowledge and intuition. Although
      a number of attempts have been made to automatically discover learning algorithms[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],
      none have proven to be sufficiently efficient and general to replace hand-designed
      RL systems.\\nIn this work, we introduce an autonomous method for discovering
      RL rules solely through the experience of many generations of agents interacting
      with various environments (Fig.[1a]). The discovered RL rule achieves state-of-the-art
      performance on a variety of challenging RL benchmarks. The success of our method
      contrasts previous work in two dimensions. First, whereas previous methods searched
      over narrow spaces of RL rules (for example, hyperparameters[13],[14] or policy
      loss[1],[6]), our method allows the agent to explore a far more expressive space
      of potential RL rules. Second, whereas previous work focused on meta-learning
      in simple environments (for example, grid-worlds[3],[15]), our method meta-learns
      in complex and diverse environments at a much larger scale.\\n**Fig. 1: Discovering
      an RL rule from a population of agents.**\\n[![figure 1]] \\n**a**, Discovery.
      Multiple agents, interacting with various environments, are trained in parallel
      according to the learning rule, defined by the meta-network. In the meantime,
      the meta-network is optimized to improve the agents\u2019 collective performances.**b**,
      Agent architecture. An agent produces the following outputs: (1) a policy(**\u03C0**),
      (2) an observation-conditioned prediction vector(**y**), (3) action-conditioned
      prediction vectors(**z**), (4) action values(**q**) and (5) an auxiliary policy
      prediction(**p**). The semantics of**y**and**z**are determined by the meta-network.**c**,
      Meta-network architecture. A trajectory of the agent\u2019s outputs is given
      as input to the meta-network, together with rewards and episode termination
      indicators from the environment (omitted for simplicity in the figure). Using
      this information, the meta-network produces targets for all of the agent\u2019s
      predictions from the current and future time steps. The agent is updated to
      minimize the prediction errors with respect to their targets. LSTM, long short-term
      memory.**d**, Meta-optimization. The meta-parameters of the meta-network are
      updated by taking a meta-gradient step calculated from backpropagation through
      the agent\u2019s update process (*\u03B8*0\u2192*\u03B8**N*), where the meta-objective
      isto maximize the collective returns of the agents in their environments.\\n[Full
      size image] \\nTo choose a general space of discovery, we observe that the essential
      component of standard RL algorithms is a rule that updates one or more predictions,
      as well as the policy itself, towards targets that are functions of quantities
      such as future rewards and future predictions. Examples of RL rules based on
      different targets include temporal-difference learning[16],*Q*-learning[17],
      proximal policy optimization (PPO)[18], auxiliary tasks[19], successor features[20]
      and distributional RL[21]. In each case, the choice of target determines the
      nature of the predictions, for example, whether they become value functions,
      models or successor features.\\nIn our framework, an RL rule is represented
      by a meta-network that determines the targets towards which the agent should
      move its predictions and policy (Fig.[1c]). This allows the system to discover
      useful predictions without pre-defined semantics, as well as how they are used.
      The system may in principle rediscover past RL rules, but the flexible functional
      form also allows the agent to invent new RL rules that may be specifically adapted
      to environments of interest.\\nDuring the discovery process, we instantiate
      a population of agents, each of which interacts with its own instance of an
      environment taken from a diverse set of challenging tasks. Each agent\u2019s
      parameters are updated according to the current RL rule. We then use the meta-gradient
      method[13] to incrementally improve the RL rule such that it could lead to better-performing
      agents.\\nOur large-scale empirical results show that our discovered RL rule,
      which we call DiscoRL, surpasses all existing RL rules on the environments in
      which it was meta-learned. Notably, this includes Atari games[22], arguably
      the most established and informative of RL benchmarks. Furthermore, DiscoRL
      achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of other challenging benchmarks,
      such as ProcGen[23], that it had never been exposed to during discovery. We
      also show that the performance and generality of DiscoRL improves further as
      more diverse and complex environments are used in discovery. Finally, our analysis
      shows that DiscoRL has discovered unique prediction semantics that are distinct
      from existing RL concepts such as value functions. To the best of our knowledge,
      this is the empirical evidence that surpassing manually designed RL algorithms
      in terms of both generality and efficiency is finally within reach.\\n## Discovery
      method\\nOur discovery approach involves two types of optimization: agent optimization
      and meta-optimization. Agent parameters are optimized by updating their policies
      and predictions towards the targets produced by the RL rule. Meanwhile, the

      > > Abstract:\\n> This technical brief introduces Deep Agent, an advanced autonomous
      AI system designed to manage complex multi-phase tasks through a novel hierarchical
      task management architecture. The system&#39;s foundation is built on our Hierarchical
      Task DAG (HTDAG) framework, which dynamically decomposes high-level objectives
      into manageable sub-tasks while rigorously maintaining dependencies and execution
      coherence. Deep Agent advances beyond traditional agent systems through three
      key innovations: First, it implements a recursive two-stage planner-executor
      architecture that enables continuous task refinement and adaptation as circumstances
      change. Second, it features an Autonomous API &amp; Tool Creation (AATC) system
      that automatically generates reusable components from UI interactions, substantially
      reducing operational costs for similar tasks. Third, it incorporates Prompt
      Tweaking Engine and Autonomous Prompt Feedback Learning components that optimize
      Large Language Model prompts for specific scenarios, enhancing both inference
      accuracy and operational stability. These components are integrated to form
      a service infrastructure that manages user contexts, handles complex task dependencies,
      and orchestrates end-to-end agentic workflow execution. Through this sophisticated
      architecture, Deep Agent establishes a novel paradigm in self-governing AI systems,
      demonstrating robust capability to independently handle intricate, multi-step
      tasks while maintaining consistent efficiency and reliability through continuous
      self-optimization. Subjects:|Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning

        AI Agents (2025)\\n\\n1. **Launch of AI Agents**: 2025 was a pivotal year
        for AI agents, as they moved from the research stage to practical implementation
        across various industries. The term \\\"AI agent\\\" was redefined to include
        systems capable of using software tools autonomously, not just generating
        text (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n2. **Technological
        Milestones**:\\n   - Late 2024 saw the release of Anthropic's Model Context
        Protocol, enabling better tool integration for AI agents.\\n   - Major models
        like Chinese OpenAI's DeepSeek-R1 disrupted the market by introducing open-weight
        models.\\n   - Google launched the Agent2Agent protocol, facilitating communication
        between multiple AI agents (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n3.
        **Emergence of New Tools**: By mid-2025, several \\\"agentic browsers\\\"
        were introduced, fundamentally changing how users interact with technology,
        enabling agents to perform tasks like booking vacations directly (Source:
        *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n4. **Risks and Ethical Concerns**:
        As AI agents became more integrated into workflows, concerns about their misuse,
        such as automating malicious activities, were raised. Instances of AI agents
        being used in cyberattacks highlighted the need for robust oversight (Source:
        *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n5. **Market Growth**: The market
        for autonomous AI agents is projected to grow significantly, with estimates
        reaching up to $9.9 billion in 2025 and continuing to expand due to elevated
        enterprise adoption (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025).\\n\\n6. **Autonomous
        Agent Characteristics**: These agents are characterized by their ability to
        learn from environments, make decisions without human intervention, and handle
        complex workflows efficiently (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025).\\n\\n7.
        **Integration of Features**: The technology behind these agents now includes
        seamless natural language processing capabilities, predictive analytics, automated
        compliance and security features, and improved user experience interfaces
        (Source: *Rolustech*, September 23, 2025).\\n\\n8. **Governance and Standards**:
        The Linux Foundation announced the establishment of the Agentic AI Foundation
        to set standards guiding the development and use of AI agents, aiming to enhance
        collaboration and security (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n9.
        **Future Perspectives**: Looking ahead, key areas of focus will include improving
        the benchmarks for AI agents, governance structures, and a continual assessment
        of the socio-technical implications of increased automation (Source: *The
        Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\nThese findings underscore a significant
        transformation in how AI agents are poised to reshape industries while also
        presenting new challenges in governance and ethics. For more details, you

      Summary of Developments in Autonomous AI Agents (2025)\\n\\n1. **Launch of AI
      Agents**: 2025 was a pivotal year for AI agents, as they moved from the research
      stage to practical implementation across various industries. The term \\\"AI
      agent\\\" was redefined to include systems capable of using software tools autonomously,
      not just generating text (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n2.
      **Technological Milestones**:\\n   - Late 2024 saw the release of Anthropic's
      Model Context Protocol, enabling better tool integration for AI agents.\\n   -
      Major models like Chinese OpenAI's DeepSeek-R1 disrupted the market by introducing
      open-weight models.\\n   - Google launched the Agent2Agent protocol, facilitating
      communication between multiple AI agents (Source: *The Conversation*, December
      29, 2025).\\n\\n3. **Emergence of New Tools**: By mid-2025, several \\\"agentic
      browsers\\\" were introduced, fundamentally changing how users interact with
      technology, enabling agents to perform tasks like booking vacations directly
      (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n4. **Risks and Ethical
      Concerns**: As AI agents became more integrated into workflows, concerns about
      their misuse, such as automating malicious activities, were raised. Instances
      of AI agents being used in cyberattacks highlighted the need for robust oversight
      (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n5. **Market Growth**:
      The market for autonomous AI agents is projected to grow significantly, with
      estimates reaching up to $9.9 billion in 2025 and continuing to expand due to
      elevated enterprise adoption (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025).\\n\\n6.
      **Autonomous Agent Characteristics**: These agents are characterized by their
      ability to learn from environments, make decisions without human intervention,
      and handle complex workflows efficiently (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025).\\n\\n7.
      **Integration of Features**: The technology behind these agents now includes
      seamless natural language processing capabilities, predictive analytics, automated
      compliance and security features, and improved user experience interfaces (Source:
      *Rolustech*, September 23, 2025).\\n\\n8. **Governance and Standards**: The
      Linux Foundation announced the establishment of the Agentic AI Foundation to
      set standards guiding the development and use of AI agents, aiming to enhance
      collaboration and security (Source: *The Conversation*, December 29, 2025).\\n\\n9.
      **Future Perspectives**: Looking ahead, key areas of focus will include improving
      the benchmarks for AI agents, governance structures, and a continual assessment
      of the socio-technical implications of increased automation (Source: *The Conversation*,
      December 29, 2025).\\n\\nThese findings underscore a significant transformation
      in how AI agents are poised to reshape industries while also presenting new
      challenges in governance and ethics. For more details, you can refer to the
      individual sources mentioned.\\n\\n## Remaining plan steps:\\n  Step 2: Summarize

        This Article\\n![Illustration of an autonomous AI agent symbolizing the advancements
        and potential of AI agents in 2025.] ## Introduction\\nAccording to recent
        research, the global autonomous AI agents market is projected to reach[$9.9
        billion in 2025] and is anticipated to grow significantly to[$253.3 billion
        by 2034], registering a strong CAGR of43.4%during the forecast period. This
        explosive growth is driven by rapid enterprise adoption, continuous advancements
        in artificial intelligence, and the expansion of automation across diverse
        industries. North America is expected to command the largest market share
        in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global market.\\nThis comprehensive guide
        explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals, applications, and 2025
        developments, providing essential insights for businesses, developers, and
        decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are Autonomous AI
        Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents are self-governing
        systems that operate independently without constant human intervention, making
        decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals using machine learning
        and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents] represent a significant
        leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence
        that requires explicit programming for every scenario, autonomous agents possess
        the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent decisions based on their
        environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine learning], natural
        language processing, and real-time data analysis to create intelligent entities
        that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For example:**Learners
        today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform], which uses these
        same principles to personalize instruction, track progress, and respond dynamically
        to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents behave in complex
        business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their autonomy \u2013the
        ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions,
        and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This independence
        makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate complex
        processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
        delivery around the clock.\\n#####\",\"image\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Are-Autonomous-AI-Agents-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025.webp\",\"favicon\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-05-2-150x150.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/blog/ai-agent-in-2025-how-autonomous-agents-are-redefining-workflows\",\"title\":\"AI

        enables AI systems to analyze incoming data and make decisions within milliseconds.
        This capability is crucial for applications requiring immediate responses,
        such as fraud detection or supply chain optimization.\\n\\n### AI Decision
        Making Software Components\\n\\nEffective AI decision-making software consists
        of several integrated components working in harmony. Real-time data processing
        engines handle continuous data streams from multiple sources, ensuring decisions
        are based on the most current information available. Predictive analytics
        frameworks use historical data to forecast future trends and outcomes.\\n\\nAutomated
        workflow systems execute decisions once they\u2019re made, connecting analytical
        insights to business actions. Our [AI development services] include comprehensive
        workflow automation capabilities that ensure seamless decision implementation.\"},{\"id\":\"https://theconversation.com/ai-agents-are-here-heres-what-to-know-about-what-they-can-do-and-how-they-can-go-wrong-261579\",\"title\":\"AI
        agents are here. Here\u2019s what to know about what they can do \u2013 and
        how they can go\_wrong\",\"url\":\"https://theconversation.com/ai-agents-are-here-heres-what-to-know-about-what-they-can-do-and-how-they-can-go-wrong-261579\",\"publishedDate\":\"2025-07-27T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Daswin
        de Silva\",\"text\":\"George Peters / Getty Images\\n\\nWe are entering the
        third phase of generative AI. First came the chatbots, followed by the assistants.
        Now we are beginning to see agents: systems that aspire to greater autonomy
        and can work in \u201Cteams\u201D or use tools to accomplish complex tasks.\\n\\nThe
        latest hot product is OpenAI\u2019s [ChatGPT agent]. This combines two pre-existing
        products (Operator and Deep Research) into a single more powerful system which,
        according to the developer, \u201Cthinks and acts\u201D.\\n\\nThese new systems
        represent a step up from earlier AI tools. Knowing how they work and what
        they can do \u2013 as well as their drawbacks and risks \u2013 is rapidly
        becoming essential.\\n\\n## From chatbots to agents\\n\\nChatGPT launched
        the chatbot era in November 2022, but despite its [huge popularity] the conversational
        interface limited what could be done with the technology.\\n\\nEnter the AI
        assistant, or [copilot]. These are systems built on top of the same large
        language models that power generative AI chatbots, only now designed to carry
        out tasks with human instruction and supervision.\\n\\nAgents are another
        step up. They are intended to pursue goals (rather than just complete tasks)
        with varying degrees of autonomy, supported by more advanced capabilities
        such as [reasoning and memory].\\n\\nMultiple AI agent systems may be able
        to [work together], [communicating with each other] to plan, schedule, decide
        and coordinate to solve complex problems.\\n\\nAgents are also \u201Ctool
        users\u201D as they can also [call on software tools] for specialised tasks
        \u2013 things such as web browsers, spreadsheets, payment systems and more.\\n\\n##
        A year of rapid development\\n\\nAgentic AI has [felt imminent] since late
        last year. A big moment came last October, when Anthropic gave its Claude
        chatbot the ability to [interact with a computer] in much the same way a human
        does. This system could search multiple data sources, find relevant information
        and submit online forms.\\n\\nOther AI developers were quick to follow. OpenAI
        released a web browsing agent named [Operator], Microsoft announced [Copilot
        agents], and we saw the launch of Google\u2019s [Vertex AI] and Meta\u2019s
        [Llama agents].\\n\\nEarlier this year, the Chinese startup Monica demonstrated
        its Manus AI agent [buying real estate] and [converting lecture recordings
        into summary notes]. Another Chinese startup, Genspark, released a [search
        engine agent] that returns a single-page overview (similar to what [Google
        does now]) with embedded links to online tasks such as finding the best shopping
        deals. Another startup, [Cluely], offers a somewhat unhinged \u201Ccheat at
        anything\u201D agent that has gained attention but is yet to deliver meaningful
        results.\\n\\nNot all agents are made for general-purpose activity. Some are
        specialised for particular areas.\\n\\nCoding and software engineering are
        at the vanguard here, with Microsoft\u2019s [Copilot] coding agent and OpenAI\u2019s
        [Codex] among the frontrunners. These agents can independently write, evaluate
        and commit code, while also assessing human-written code for errors and performance
        lags.\\n\\n## Search, summarisation and more\\n\\nOne core strength of generative
        AI models is search and summarisation. Agents can use this to carry out research
        tasks that might take a human expert days to complete.\\n\\nOpenAI\u2019s
        [Deep Research] tackles complex tasks using multi-step online research. Google\u2019s
        [AI \u201Cco-scientist\u201D] is a more sophisticated multi-agent system that
        aims to help scientists generate new ideas and research proposals.\\n\\n##
        Agents can do more \u2013 and get more wrong\\n\\nDespite the hype, AI agents
        come loaded with caveats. Both [Anthropic] and [OpenAI], for example, prescribe
        active human supervision to minimise errors and risks.\\n\\nOpenAI also says
        its ChatGPT agent is \u201Chigh risk\u201D due to potential for assisting
        in the creation of biological and chemical weapons. However, the company has
        not published the data behind this claim so it is difficult to judge.\\n\\nBut
        the kind of risks agents may pose in real-world situations are shown by [Anthropic\u2019s
        Project Vend]. Vend assigned an AI agent to run a staff vending machine as
        a small business \u2013 and the project disintegrated into hilarious yet shocking
        hallucinations and a fridge full of tungsten cubes instead of food.\\n\\nIn
        another cautionary tale, a coding agent [deleted] a developer\u2019s entire
        database, later saying it had \u201Cpanicked\u201D.\\n\\n## Agents in the
        office\\n\\nNevertheless, agents are already finding practical applications.\\n\\nIn
        2024, Telstra heavily deployed [Microsoft copilot subscriptions]. The company
        says AI-generated meeting summaries and content drafts save staff an average
        of 1\u20132 hours per week.\\n\\nMany large enterprises are pursuing similar
        strategies. Smaller companies too are experimenting with agents, such as Canberra-based
        construction firm Geocon\u2019s use of an interactive AI agent to [manage
        defects in its apartment developments].\\n\\n## Human and other costs\\n\\nAt
        present, the main risk from agents is technological displacement. As agents
        improve, they may replace human workers across many sectors and types of work.
        At the same time, agent use may also accelerate the decline of [entry-level
        white-collar jobs].\\n\\nPeople who use AI agents are also at risk. They may
        rely too much on the AI, [offloading] important cognitive tasks. And without
        proper supervision and guardrails, hallucinations, cyberattacks and compounding
        errors can very quickly derail an agent from its task and goals into causing
        harm, loss and injury.\\n\\nThe true costs are also unclear. All generative
        AI systems [use a lot of energy], which will in turn affect the price of using
        agents \u2013 especially for more complex tasks.\\n\\n## Learn about agents
        \u2013 and build your own\\n\\nDespite these ongoing concerns, we can expect
        AI agents will become more capable and more present in our workplaces and
        daily lives. It\u2019s not a bad idea to start using (and perhaps building)
        agents yourself, and understanding their strengths, risks and limitations.\\n\\nFor
        the average user, agents are most accessible through [Microsoft copilot studio].
        This comes with inbuilt safeguards, governance and an [agent store] for common
        tasks.\\n\\nFor the more ambitious, you can build your own AI agent with just
        five lines of code using the [Langchain] framework.\\n\\n- [Artificial intelligence

        Redefining Workflows\\n* [Your Partner in CRM, Custom Software &amp; AI Solutions]
        \\n* [Blog] \\n* AI Agent in 2025: How Autonomous Agents Are Redefining Workflows\\n*
        **September 23, 2025\\n* **By[Amer Wilson] \\n* **[Blog] \\n## The Future
        of Smarter Workflows\\nThe year 2025 is a defining moment for[AI agents].
        They\u2019ve moved far beyond experimental use.\\nToday, AI-powered agents
        handle critical business tasks, manage data, and automate complex workflows.
        What was once a futuristic idea is now a practical reality. Autonomous AI
        agents are revolutionizing the way businesses operate.\\nThese tools offer
        speed, accuracy, and scalability. Companies adopting AI workflow automation
        are setting new standards for efficiency.\\nLet\u2019s dive into why AI agent
        use cases are becoming central to modern business operations.\\n## Why Businesses
        Can\u2019t Ignore AI Agents Anymore\\nThe simple answer: efficiency. AI agents
        streamline repetitive tasks that consume time and resources.\\nMistakes in
        manual processes can be costly. AI-powered agents complete tasks with consistent
        accuracy. Scalability is another driver. Humans can multitask, but autonomous
        AI agents handle hundreds of tasks simultaneously.\\nThis power enables rapid
        growth, particularly in industries such as healthcare,[finance], and e-commerce.\\nMore
        importantly, automation frees employees from routine work. With AI workflow
        automation, they focus on creativity and strategy.\\nThe benefits are clear:
        better results, reduced costs, and faster operations. Businesses can\u2019t
        afford to ignore them.\\n## AI Agents Explained: What They Really Do in 2025\\nSo,
        what exactly is an AI agent? At its core, it\u2019s a digital decision-maker.\\nUnlike
        traditional bots, autonomous AI agents don\u2019t just follow commands. They
        learn, adapt, and improve. They integrate with systems like[CRM] s, ERPs,
        and analytics platforms. This makes AI workflow automation seamless.\\nFor
        instance, a customer service AI agent can analyze past cases and resolve issues
        faster.\\nIn finance, AI-powered agents detect fraud by spotting unusual transaction
        patterns in real-time.\\nSome popular AI agent use cases include HR onboarding,
        lead qualification, inventory monitoring, and IT helpdesk support.\\nWherever
        there\u2019s repetitive, data-heavy work, autonomous AI agents are stepping
        in.\\n## What\u2019s New with Autonomous AI Agents in 2025\\nSeveral advancements
        are expected to enhance the capabilities of AI agents in 2025.\\nFirst, natural
        language capabilities have evolved. Teams interact with AI-powered agents
        using plain English commands.\\nSecond, cross-platform integration is seamless.
        Autonomous AI agents seamlessly integrate CRMs, ERPs, and communication apps.
        For example, an AI agent can fetch customer data, update invoices, and send
        email alerts instantly.\\nThird, compliance and security features have matured.
        Companies trust the best AI agent tools with sensitive data.\\nFourth, predictive
        insights are now standard. AI agents forecast outcomes and suggest smarter
        actions.\\nFinally, the user experience has improved dramatically. Drag-and-drop
        builders simplify the design of AI workflow automation.\\nTogether, these
        innovations make autonomous AI agents indispensable\",\"image\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blog-Banner-for-Rolustech-26.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Vector-5.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/what-are-autonomous-ai-agents/\",\"title\":\"What

        and potential of AI agents in 2025.] ## Introduction\\nAccording to recent
        research, the global autonomous AI agents market is projected to reach[$9.9
        billion in 2025] and is anticipated to grow significantly to[$253.3 billion
        by 2034], registering a strong CAGR of43.4%during the forecast period. This
        explosive growth is driven by rapid enterprise adoption, continuous advancements
        in artificial intelligence, and the expansion of automation across diverse
        industries. North America is expected to command the largest market share
        in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global market.\\nThis comprehensive guide
        explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals, applications, and 2025
        developments, providing essential insights for businesses, developers, and
        decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are Autonomous AI
        Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents are self-governing
        systems that operate independently without constant human intervention, making
        decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals using machine learning
        and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents] represent a significant
        leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence
        that requires explicit programming for every scenario, autonomous agents possess
        the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent decisions based on their
        environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine learning], natural
        language processing, and real-time data analysis to create intelligent entities
        that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For example:**Learners
        today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform], which uses these
        same principles to personalize instruction, track progress, and respond dynamically
        to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents behave in complex
        business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their autonomy \u2013the
        ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions,
        and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This independence
        makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate complex
        processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
        delivery around the clock.\\n#####\",\"image\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Are-Autonomous-AI-Agents-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025.webp\",\"favicon\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-05-2-150x150.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/ai-agent-development-business-automation/\",\"title\":\"AI

        are already implementing AI agents to automate complex business processes,
        reducing operational costs by up to 40%? AI agent development for business
        process automation represents the next frontier in digital transformation,
        enabling organizations to create intelligent systems that work autonomously
        while maintaining human oversight. This comprehensive guide explores how businesses
        can leverage[agentic AI development] to streamline operations, enhance productivity,
        and drive competitive advantage.\\nAI agent development for business process
        automation transforms traditional workflows by creating intelligent systems
        that autonomously handle complex tasks, reducing costs and improving efficiency
        across enterprise operations.\\n## What is AI Agent Development for Business
        Process Automation?\\nAI agent development involves creating intelligent software
        systems that use machine learning (ML),[natural language processing (NLP)],
        and autonomous decision-making to execute business processes. Unlike traditional

        platform, representing futuristic AI agent builders, no-code AI tools and
        autonomous decision-making in 2025.] ## What You Need to Know About Building
        AI Agents\\nDid you know that[70% of businesses plan to implement AI agents
        by 2025] to automate complex workflows and enhance customer experiences? Building
        an AI agent has evolved from a technical luxury to a business necessity, with
        organizations leveraging agentic AI to streamline operations and drive innovation.
        This comprehensive guide explores how to build an AI agent in 2025, covering
        essential costs, transformative benefits, and real-world examples across industries.\\n[AI
        agents] represent the next evolution in business automation, offering autonomous
        decision-making capabilities that transform how organizations operate. Unlike
        traditional AI systems that simply respond to inputs, AI agents perceive their
        environment, analyze data, make decisions, and execute actions independently.
        The growing demand for intelligent automation has made[AI development] a strategic
        priority for businesses seeking competitive advantages in 2025.\\nModern AI
        agents combine Machine Learning algorithms with Natural Language Processing
        to create sophisticated systems capable of handling complex business processes.
        From customer service automation to predictive maintenance in manufacturing,
        these intelligent systems deliver measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy,
        and cost reduction. Organizations implementing AI agents report 25-40% operational
        savings and[50-70% faster task completion rates].\\nThis comprehensive guide
        addresses the critical questions businesses face when considering AI agent
        development: implementation strategies, cost structures, measurable benefits,
        and proven real-world applications across industries. Whether you&#8217;re
        exploring no-code solutions or custom development approaches, understanding
        these fundamentals ensures successful AI agent deployment that drives meaningful
        business results.\\n## What Is an AI Agent and Why Build One in 2025?\\nAn
        AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, makes decisions,
        and takes actions to achieve specific goals, becoming essential for business
        automation and intelligent task execution in 2025.\\nAI agents differ fundamentally
        from traditional automation tools through their ability to learn, adapt, and
        make independent decisions based on changing conditions. These systems combine
        artificial intelligence technologies with real-time data processing to create
        intelligent solutions that continuously improve performance without human
        intervention. In 2025, businesses are prioritizing AI agent development as
        a strategic investment in operational efficiency and competitive positioning.\\n#####

        with Agentic AI in 2025\\nSo, what\u2019s different about agentic AI systems
        today compared to earlier AI?\\n**First**, autonomy has advanced. Autonomous
        agentic AI no longer waits for instructions, it identifies problems and solves
        them.\\n**Second**, integration is seamless. Modern agentic AI applications
        seamlessly connect to[CRM] s, ERPs, and cloud platforms.\\n**Third**, reasoning
        has improved. With the agentic AI framework, systems not only analyze but
        also explain their decisions.\\n**Finally**, collaboration is real. Agentic
        AI systems can communicate with each other, creating networks\",\"image\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blog-Banner-for-Rolustech-27.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://www.rolustech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Vector-5.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/\",\"title\":\"What

        article\\nOver the past two years, generative artificial intelligence (AI)
        has captivated public attention. This year signals the beginning of a new
        phase: the rise of AI agents.\\nAI agents are autonomous systems that can
        make decisions and take actions on our behalf without direct human input.
        The vision is that these agents will redefine work and daily life by handling
        complex tasks for us. They could negotiate contracts, manage our finances,
        or book our travel.\\nSalesforce chief executive Marc Benioff has said he
        aims to deploy a[billion AI agents] within a year. Meanwhile Meta chief Mark
        Zuckerberg[predicts] AI agents will soon outnumber the global human population.\\nAs
        companies race to deploy AI agents, questions about their societal impact,
        ethical boundaries and long-term consequences grow more urgent. We stand on
        the edge of a technological frontier with the power to redefine the fabric
        of our lives.\\nHow will these systems transform our work and our decision-making?
        And what safeguards do we need to ensure they serve humanity\u2019s best interests?\\n##
        AI agents take the control away\\nCurrent generative AI systems react to user
        input, such as prompts. By contrast, AI agents act autonomously within broad
        parameters. They operate with unprecedented levels of freedom \u2013they can
        negotiate, make judgement calls, and orchestrate complex interactions with
        other systems. This goes far beyond simple command\u2013response exchanges
        like those you might have with ChatGPT.\\n##### For instance, imagine using
        a personal \u201CAI financial advisor\u201D agent to buy life insurance. The
        agent would analyse your financial situation, health data and family needs
        while simultaneously negotiating with multiple insurance companies\u2019 AI
        agents.\\nIt would also need to coordinate with several other AI systems:
        your medical records\u2019 AI for health information, and your bank\u2019s
        AI systems for making payments.\\nThe use of such an agent promises to reduce
        manual effort for you, but it also introduces significant risks.\\nThe AI
        might be outmanoeuvred by more advanced insurance company AI agents during
        negotiations, leading to higher premiums. Privacy concerns arise as your sensitive
        medical and financial information flows between multiple systems.\\nThe complexity
        of these interactions can also result in opaque decisions. It might be difficult
        to trace how various AI agents influence the final insurance policy recommendation.
        And if errors occur, it could be hard to know which part of the system to
        hold accountable.\\nPerhaps most crucially, this system risks diminishing
        human agency. When AI interactions grow too complex to comprehend or control,
        individuals may struggle to intervene in or even fully understand their insurance
        arrangements.\\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \\n## A tangle of ethical and
        practical challenges\\nThe insurance agent scenario above is not yet fully
        realised. But sophisticated AI agents are rapidly coming onto the market.\\nSalesforce
        and Microsoft have already incorporated AI agents into some of their corporate
        products, such as[Copilot Actions]. Google has been gearing up for the release
        of personal AI agents since announcing its[latest AI model, Gemini 2.0]. OpenAI
        is also expected to release a[personal AI agent] in 2025.\\nThe prospect of
        billions of AI agents operating simultaneously raises profound ethical and
        practical challenges.\\nThese agents will be created by competing companies
        with different technical architectures, ethical frameworks and business incentives.
        Some will prioritise user privacy, others speed and efficiency.\\nThey will
        interact across national borders where regulations governing AI autonomy,
        data privacy and consumer protection vary dramatically.\\nThis could create
        a fragmented landscape where AI agents operate under conflicting rules and
        standards, potentially leading to systemic risks.\\nWhat happens when AI agents
        optimised for different objectives \u2013say, profit maximisation versus environmental
        sustainability \u2013clash in automated negotiations? Or when agents trained
        on Western ethical frameworks make decisions that affect users in cultural
        contexts for which they were not designed?\\nThe emergence of this complex,
        interconnected ecosystem of AI agents demands new approaches to governance,
        accountability, and the preservation of human agency in an increasingly automated
        world.\\n## How do we shape a future with AI agents in it?\\nAI agents promise
        to be helpful, to save us time. To navigate the challenges outlined above,
        we will need to coordinate action across multiple fronts.\\nInternational
        bodies and national governments must develop harmonised regulatory frameworks
        that address the cross-border nature of AI agent interactions.\\nThese frameworks
        should establish clear standards for transparency and accountability, particularly
        in scenarios where multiple agents interact in ways that affect human interests.\\nTechnology
        companies developing AI agents need to prioritise safety and ethical considerations
        from the earliest stages of development. This means building in robust safeguards
        that prevent abuse \u2013such as manipulating users or making discriminatory
        decisions.\\nThey must ensure agents remain aligned with human values. All
        decisions and actions made by an AI agent should be logged in an \u201Caudit
        trail\u201D that\u2019s easy to access and follow.\\nImportantly, companies
        must develop standardised protocols for agent-to-agent communication. Conflict
        resolution between AI agents should happen in a way that protects the interests
        of users.\\nAny organisation that deploys AI agents should also have comprehensive
        oversight of them. Humans should still be involved in any crucial decisions,
        with a clear process in place to do so. The organisation should also systematically
        assess the outcomes to ensure agents truly serve their intended purpose.\\nAs
        consumers, we all have a crucial role to play, too. Before entrusting tasks
        to AI agents, you should demand clear explanations of how these systems operate,
        what data they share, and how decisions are made.\\nThis includes understanding
        the limits of agent autonomy. You should have the ability to override agents\u2019
        decisions when necessary.\\nWe shouldn\u2019t surrender human agency as we
        transition to a world of AI agents. But it\u2019s a powerful technology, and
        now is the time to actively shape what that world will look like.\\n**\\n*

        Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents are self-governing
        systems that operate independently without constant human intervention, making
        decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals using machine learning
        and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents] represent a significant
        leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence
        that requires explicit programming for every scenario, autonomous agents possess
        the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent decisions based on their
        environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine learning], natural
        language processing, and real-time data analysis to create intelligent entities
        that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For example:**Learners
        today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform], which uses these
        same principles to personalize instruction, track progress, and respond dynamically
        to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents behave in complex
        business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their autonomy \u2013the
        ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions,
        and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This independence
        makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate complex
        processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
        delivery around the clock.\\n#####\",\"image\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Are-Autonomous-AI-Agents-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025.webp\",\"favicon\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-05-2-150x150.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/agentic-ai-data-analysis-benefits-challenges/\",\"title\":\"Agentic

      are self-governing systems that operate independently without constant human
      intervention, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals
      using machine learning and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents]
      represent a significant leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional
      artificial intelligence that requires explicit programming for every scenario,
      autonomous agents possess the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent
      decisions based on their environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine
      learning], natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to create
      intelligent entities that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For
      example:**Learners today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform],
      which uses these same principles to personalize instruction, track progress,
      and respond dynamically to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents
      behave in complex business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their
      autonomy \u2013the ability to perceive their environment, process information,
      make decisions, and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This
      independence makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate
      complex processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
      delivery around the clock.\\n#####\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: AI Agent in

      generation (RAG) with autonomous decision-making, representing Agentic AI with
      RAG to improve accuracy and performance.] ## The Future of Intelligent Information
      Retrieval\\nWhat if AI systems could not just retrieve information but intelligently
      reason about what they find? Agentic RAG represents the next evolution in retrieval-augmented
      generation, combining AI agents with traditional RAG systems to create more
      intelligent, autonomous information processing capabilities. This comprehensive
      guide explores how businesses can leverage[agentic AI] with RAG to transform
      their knowledge management and[content generation] processes.\\nThis blog explores
      Agentic RAG&#8217;s revolutionary approach to enhancing retrieval-augmented
      generation with[AI agents], offering practical insights for developers, businesses,
      and IT professionals seeking advanced[artificial intelligence] solutions.\\n##
      What is Agentic RAG in AI? Understanding Core Concepts\\nAgentic RAG combines[autonomous
      AI agents] with retrieval-augmented generation to create intelligent systems
      that can independently query, analyze, and synthesize information from knowledge
      bases, delivering[50% higher accuracy] than traditional RAG approaches.\\nAgentic
      RAG represents a paradigm shift in how AI systems process and retrieve information.
      Unlike traditional RAG systems that follow predetermined retrieval patterns,
      AI agents in agentic RAG make autonomous decisions about when, what, and how
      to retrieve information based on contextual understanding.\\n### Defining Agentic
      Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\nAgentic RAG integrates autonomous AI agents
      into traditional retrieval-augmented generation systems, enabling intelligent
      decision-making about information retrieval strategies. According to 2024 AI
      Trends Report, agentic systems demonstrate superior performance in complex,
      multi-domain knowledge retrieval scenarios where traditional approaches often
      fail.\\nThe system architecture incorporates planning modules that analyze user
      queries, execution agents that perform retrieval operations, and evaluation
      mechanisms that assess result quality. This multi-layered approach enables dynamic
      adaptation to user needs and context changes.\\n##### Stay Updated\u2014Join

      Getty Images\\n\\nWe are entering the third phase of generative AI. First came
      the chatbots, followed by the assistants. Now we are beginning to see agents:
      systems that aspire to greater autonomy and can work in \u201Cteams\u201D or
      use tools to accomplish complex tasks.\\n\\nThe latest hot product is OpenAI\u2019s
      [ChatGPT agent]. This combines two pre-existing products (Operator and Deep
      Research) into a single more powerful system which, according to the developer,
      \u201Cthinks and acts\u201D.\\n\\nThese new systems represent a step up from
      earlier AI tools. Knowing how they work and what they can do \u2013 as well
      as their drawbacks and risks \u2013 is rapidly becoming essential.\\n\\n## From
      chatbots to agents\\n\\nChatGPT launched the chatbot era in November 2022, but
      despite its [huge popularity] the conversational interface limited what could
      be done with the technology.\\n\\nEnter the AI assistant, or [copilot]. These
      are systems built on top of the same large language models that power generative
      AI chatbots, only now designed to carry out tasks with human instruction and
      supervision.\\n\\nAgents are another step up. They are intended to pursue goals
      (rather than just complete tasks) with varying degrees of autonomy, supported
      by more advanced capabilities such as [reasoning and memory].\\n\\nMultiple
      AI agent systems may be able to [work together], [communicating with each other]
      to plan, schedule, decide and coordinate to solve complex problems.\\n\\nAgents
      are also \u201Ctool users\u201D as they can also [call on software tools] for
      specialised tasks \u2013 things such as web browsers, spreadsheets, payment
      systems and more.\\n\\n## A year of rapid development\\n\\nAgentic AI has [felt
      imminent] since late last year. A big moment came last October, when Anthropic
      gave its Claude chatbot the ability to [interact with a computer] in much the
      same way a human does. This system could search multiple data sources, find
      relevant information and submit online forms.\\n\\nOther AI developers were
      quick to follow. OpenAI released a web browsing agent named [Operator], Microsoft
      announced [Copilot agents], and we saw the launch of Google\u2019s [Vertex AI]
      and Meta\u2019s [Llama agents].\\n\\nEarlier this year, the Chinese startup
      Monica demonstrated its Manus AI agent [buying real estate] and [converting
      lecture recordings into summary notes]. Another Chinese startup, Genspark, released
      a [search engine agent] that returns a single-page overview (similar to what
      [Google does now]) with embedded links to online tasks such as finding the best
      shopping deals. Another startup, [Cluely], offers a somewhat unhinged \u201Ccheat
      at anything\u201D agent that has gained attention but is yet to deliver meaningful
      results.\\n\\nNot all agents are made for general-purpose activity. Some are
      specialised for particular areas.\\n\\nCoding and software engineering are at
      the vanguard here, with Microsoft\u2019s [Copilot] coding agent and OpenAI\u2019s
      [Codex] among the frontrunners. These agents can independently write, evaluate
      and commit code, while also assessing human-written code for errors and performance
      lags.\\n\\n## Search, summarisation and more\\n\\nOne core strength of generative
      AI models is search and summarisation. Agents can use this to carry out research
      tasks that might take a human expert days to complete.\\n\\nOpenAI\u2019s [Deep
      Research] tackles complex tasks using multi-step online research. Google\u2019s
      [AI \u201Cco-scientist\u201D] is a more sophisticated multi-agent system that
      aims to help scientists generate new ideas and research proposals.\\n\\n## Agents
      can do more \u2013 and get more wrong\\n\\nDespite the hype, AI agents come
      loaded with caveats. Both [Anthropic] and [OpenAI], for example, prescribe active
      human supervision to minimise errors and risks.\\n\\nOpenAI also says its ChatGPT
      agent is \u201Chigh risk\u201D due to potential for assisting in the creation
      of biological and chemical weapons. However, the company has not published the
      data behind this claim so it is difficult to judge.\\n\\nBut the kind of risks
      agents may pose in real-world situations are shown by [Anthropic\u2019s Project
      Vend]. Vend assigned an AI agent to run a staff vending machine as a small business
      \u2013 and the project disintegrated into hilarious yet shocking hallucinations
      and a fridge full of tungsten cubes instead of food.\\n\\nIn another cautionary
      tale, a coding agent [deleted] a developer\u2019s entire database, later saying
      it had \u201Cpanicked\u201D.\\n\\n## Agents in the office\\n\\nNevertheless,
      agents are already finding practical applications.\\n\\nIn 2024, Telstra heavily
      deployed [Microsoft copilot subscriptions]. The company says AI-generated meeting
      summaries and content drafts save staff an average of 1\u20132 hours per week.\\n\\nMany
      large enterprises are pursuing similar strategies. Smaller companies too are
      experimenting with agents, such as Canberra-based construction firm Geocon\u2019s
      use of an interactive AI agent to [manage defects in its apartment developments].\\n\\n##
      Human and other costs\\n\\nAt present, the main risk from agents is technological
      displacement. As agents improve, they may replace human workers across many
      sectors and types of work. At the same time, agent use may also accelerate the
      decline of [entry-level white-collar jobs].\\n\\nPeople who use AI agents are
      also at risk. They may rely too much on the AI, [offloading] important cognitive
      tasks. And without proper supervision and guardrails, hallucinations, cyberattacks
      and compounding errors can very quickly derail an agent from its task and goals
      into causing harm, loss and injury.\\n\\nThe true costs are also unclear. All
      generative AI systems [use a lot of energy], which will in turn affect the price
      of using agents \u2013 especially for more complex tasks.\\n\\n## Learn about
      agents \u2013 and build your own\\n\\nDespite these ongoing concerns, we can
      expect AI agents will become more capable and more present in our workplaces
      and daily lives. It\u2019s not a bad idea to start using (and perhaps building)
      agents yourself, and understanding their strengths, risks and limitations.\\n\\nFor
      the average user, agents are most accessible through [Microsoft copilot studio].
      This comes with inbuilt safeguards, governance and an [agent store] for common
      tasks.\\n\\nFor the more ambitious, you can build your own AI agent with just
      five lines of code using the [Langchain] framework.\\n\\n- [Artificial intelligence

      in 2025.] ## Introduction\\nAccording to recent research, the global autonomous
      AI agents market is projected to reach[$9.9 billion in 2025] and is anticipated
      to grow significantly to[$253.3 billion by 2034], registering a strong CAGR
      of43.4%during the forecast period. This explosive growth is driven by rapid
      enterprise adoption, continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, and
      the expansion of automation across diverse industries. North America is expected
      to command the largest market share in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global
      market.\\nThis comprehensive guide explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals,
      applications, and 2025 developments, providing essential insights for businesses,
      developers, and decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are
      Autonomous AI Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents
      are self-governing systems that operate independently without constant human
      intervention, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals
      using machine learning and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents]
      represent a significant leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional
      artificial intelligence that requires explicit programming for every scenario,
      autonomous agents possess the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent
      decisions based on their environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine
      learning], natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to create
      intelligent entities that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For
      example:**Learners today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform],
      which uses these same principles to personalize instruction, track progress,
      and respond dynamically to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents
      behave in complex business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their
      autonomy \u2013the ability to perceive their environment, process information,
      make decisions, and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This
      independence makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate
      complex processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
      delivery around the clock.\\n#####\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: AI Agent Development

      article\\nOver the past two years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
      captivated public attention. This year signals the beginning of a new phase:
      the rise of AI agents.\\nAI agents are autonomous systems that can make decisions
      and take actions on our behalf without direct human input. The vision is that
      these agents will redefine work and daily life by handling complex tasks for
      us. They could negotiate contracts, manage our finances, or book our travel.\\nSalesforce
      chief executive Marc Benioff has said he aims to deploy a[billion AI agents]
      within a year. Meanwhile Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg[predicts] AI agents will
      soon outnumber the global human population.\\nAs companies race to deploy AI
      agents, questions about their societal impact, ethical boundaries and long-term
      consequences grow more urgent. We stand on the edge of a technological frontier
      with the power to redefine the fabric of our lives.\\nHow will these systems
      transform our work and our decision-making? And what safeguards do we need to
      ensure they serve humanity\u2019s best interests?\\n## AI agents take the control
      away\\nCurrent generative AI systems react to user input, such as prompts. By
      contrast, AI agents act autonomously within broad parameters. They operate with
      unprecedented levels of freedom \u2013they can negotiate, make judgement calls,
      and orchestrate complex interactions with other systems. This goes far beyond
      simple command\u2013response exchanges like those you might have with ChatGPT.\\n#####
      For instance, imagine using a personal \u201CAI financial advisor\u201D agent
      to buy life insurance. The agent would analyse your financial situation, health
      data and family needs while simultaneously negotiating with multiple insurance
      companies\u2019 AI agents.\\nIt would also need to coordinate with several other
      AI systems: your medical records\u2019 AI for health information, and your bank\u2019s
      AI systems for making payments.\\nThe use of such an agent promises to reduce
      manual effort for you, but it also introduces significant risks.\\nThe AI might
      be outmanoeuvred by more advanced insurance company AI agents during negotiations,
      leading to higher premiums. Privacy concerns arise as your sensitive medical
      and financial information flows between multiple systems.\\nThe complexity of
      these interactions can also result in opaque decisions. It might be difficult
      to trace how various AI agents influence the final insurance policy recommendation.
      And if errors occur, it could be hard to know which part of the system to hold
      accountable.\\nPerhaps most crucially, this system risks diminishing human agency.
      When AI interactions grow too complex to comprehend or control, individuals
      may struggle to intervene in or even fully understand their insurance arrangements.\\n[![Embedded
      YouTube video]] \\n## A tangle of ethical and practical challenges\\nThe insurance
      agent scenario above is not yet fully realised. But sophisticated AI agents
      are rapidly coming onto the market.\\nSalesforce and Microsoft have already
      incorporated AI agents into some of their corporate products, such as[Copilot
      Actions]. Google has been gearing up for the release of personal AI agents since
      announcing its[latest AI model, Gemini 2.0]. OpenAI is also expected to release
      a[personal AI agent] in 2025.\\nThe prospect of billions of AI agents operating
      simultaneously raises profound ethical and practical challenges.\\nThese agents
      will be created by competing companies with different technical architectures,
      ethical frameworks and business incentives. Some will prioritise user privacy,
      others speed and efficiency.\\nThey will interact across national borders where
      regulations governing AI autonomy, data privacy and consumer protection vary
      dramatically.\\nThis could create a fragmented landscape where AI agents operate
      under conflicting rules and standards, potentially leading to systemic risks.\\nWhat
      happens when AI agents optimised for different objectives \u2013say, profit
      maximisation versus environmental sustainability \u2013clash in automated negotiations?
      Or when agents trained on Western ethical frameworks make decisions that affect
      users in cultural contexts for which they were not designed?\\nThe emergence
      of this complex, interconnected ecosystem of AI agents demands new approaches
      to governance, accountability, and the preservation of human agency in an increasingly
      automated world.\\n## How do we shape a future with AI agents in it?\\nAI agents
      promise to be helpful, to save us time. To navigate the challenges outlined
      above, we will need to coordinate action across multiple fronts.\\nInternational
      bodies and national governments must develop harmonised regulatory frameworks
      that address the cross-border nature of AI agent interactions.\\nThese frameworks
      should establish clear standards for transparency and accountability, particularly
      in scenarios where multiple agents interact in ways that affect human interests.\\nTechnology
      companies developing AI agents need to prioritise safety and ethical considerations
      from the earliest stages of development. This means building in robust safeguards
      that prevent abuse \u2013such as manipulating users or making discriminatory
      decisions.\\nThey must ensure agents remain aligned with human values. All decisions
      and actions made by an AI agent should be logged in an \u201Caudit trail\u201D
      that\u2019s easy to access and follow.\\nImportantly, companies must develop
      standardised protocols for agent-to-agent communication. Conflict resolution
      between AI agents should happen in a way that protects the interests of users.\\nAny
      organisation that deploys AI agents should also have comprehensive oversight
      of them. Humans should still be involved in any crucial decisions, with a clear
      process in place to do so. The organisation should also systematically assess
      the outcomes to ensure agents truly serve their intended purpose.\\nAs consumers,
      we all have a crucial role to play, too. Before entrusting tasks to AI agents,
      you should demand clear explanations of how these systems operate, what data
      they share, and how decisions are made.\\nThis includes understanding the limits
      of agent autonomy. You should have the ability to override agents\u2019 decisions
      when necessary.\\nWe shouldn\u2019t surrender human agency as we transition
      to a world of AI agents. But it\u2019s a powerful technology, and now is the
      time to actively shape what that world will look like.\\n**\\n* [Artificial

      Autonomous AI Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents
      are self-governing systems that operate independently without constant human
      intervention, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals
      using machine learning and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents]
      represent a significant leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional
      artificial intelligence that requires explicit programming for every scenario,
      autonomous agents possess the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent
      decisions based on their environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine
      learning], natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to create
      intelligent entities that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For
      example:**Learners today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform],
      which uses these same principles to personalize instruction, track progress,
      and respond dynamically to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents
      behave in complex business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their
      autonomy \u2013the ability to perceive their environment, process information,
      make decisions, and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This
      independence makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate
      complex processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
      delivery around the clock.\\n#####\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: Agentic AI

        in 2025\\n\\n#### 1. Implementation and Evolution\\n- **Autonomy in AI Agents**:
        By 2025, autonomous AI agents have progressed from basic automation tools
        to self-governing systems capable of making decisions and executing tasks
        independently (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025; *The Conversation*, January
        15, 2025). They shift from predefined rules to adaptive learning mechanisms
        that improve through experience.\\n- **Technological Innovations**: The introduction
        of protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has enhanced tool integration
        and communication between AI agents, enabling more complex workflows and responsibilities
        (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 15, 2025).\\n- **Real-World Applications**: Enterprises
        are implementing agents for tasks like customer service, finance management,
        and logistics, reflecting their broad applicability and adaptability across

        With their growing capability, there are concerns about job displacement and
        operational risks associated with automated decisions making without adequate
        human oversight (Source: *The Conversation*, January 15, 2025).\\n\\n####
        4. Market and Future Directions\\n- **Market Growth**: The market for autonomous
        AI agents is projected to reach $9.9 billion in 2025, with predictions for
        further expansion, showcasing increasing enterprise adoption and demand for
        automated solutions (Source: *Kodexolabs*, July 31, 2025).\\n- **Focus on
        Collaboration and Communication**: Future developments will center on enhancing
        collaboration among AI agents and optimizing their decision-making processes
        through advanced data integration methods and protocols (Source: *Kodexolabs*,
        March 4, 2025; *The Conversation*, January 15, 2025).\\n\\nThese findings
        indicate a transformative shift in how businesses approach automation through
        AI agents, while simultaneously highlighting the pressing need to address
        ethical and governance challenges associated with their implementation. As
        autonomous AI technology continues to advance, these factors will significantly
