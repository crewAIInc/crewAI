        \\nStaff Editor, AI Models\\nIBM Think\\n## AI agents in 2025: Expectations
        vs. reality\\nIt\u2019s impossible to take two steps across the tech media
        landscape without stumbling over an article hailing 2025 as the year of the[AI
        agent]. Agents, we\u2019re told, will transform the way work is done, impacting
        every facet of our lives, personal and professional.\\nWe\u2019d barely surfaced
        from a landslide of NFT and crypto hype that characterized the early 2020s,
        and the metaverse bubble that followed, before media voices began singing
        the praises of[generative AI] (gen AI) in the wake of releases such as OpenAI\u2019s[GPT]
        model family, Anthropic\u2019s[Claude] and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.\\nWhile
        the chorus hasn\u2019t moved on entirely, the focus in 2025 has shifted from[large
        language models (LLMs)] to advancements in the ostensibly autonomous[artificial
        intelligence (AI)] agents ushering in the future of work.\\nDespite a momentary
        surge in gen AI interest around[Deepseek] \u2019s R1, which promised significant
        performance improvements over ChatGPT, the dominant innovation narrative in
        2025 is the AI agent.\\nMedia coverage highlights the promises of innovation,[automation]
        and efficiency agents will bring, but how much of the conversation is click-hungry
        hype?\\nThe ad-supported media world thrives on clicks, and it\u2019s reasonable
        to expect sensational, attention-grabbing headlines crafted to garner yours.
        But what can we realistically expect from[agentic AI] in 2025, and how will
        it affect our lives?\\nWe spoke with several IBM experts to cut through the
        hype, with the goal of holding a more reasonable conversation about AI agents
        and what they\u2019re going to do. Our team of informed insiders includes:\\n*

        capable of acting autonomously to understand, plan and execute tasks. AI agents
        are powered by LLMs and can interface with tools, other models and other aspects
        of a system or network as needed to fulfill user goals.\\nWe\u2019re going
        beyond asking a chatbot to suggest a dinner recipe based on the available
        ingredients in the fridge. Agents are more than automated[customer experience]
        emails that inform you it\u2019ll be a few days until a real-world human can
        get to your inquiry.\\n[AI agents differ from traditional AI assistants] that
        need a prompt each time they generate a response. In theory, a user gives
        an agent a high-level task, and the agent figures out how to complete it.\\nCurrent
        offerings are still in the early stages of approaching this idea. \u201CWhat\u2019s
        commonly referred to as \u2018agents\u2019 in the market is the addition of
        rudimentary planning and tool-calling (sometimes called function calling)
        capabilities to LLMs,\u201D says Ashoori. \u201CThese enable the LLM to break
        down complex tasks into smaller steps that the LLM can perform.\u201D\\nHay
        is optimistic that more robust agents are on the way: \u201CYou wouldn\u2019t
        need any further progression in models today to build[future AI agents],\u201D
        he says.\\nWith that out of the way, what\u2019s the conversation about agents
        over the coming year, and how much of it can we take seriously?\\nAI agents\\n###

        capabilities and adaptability.\\n[\\nLearn more\\n] \\n## Narrative 1: 2025
        is the year of the AI agent\\n\u201CMore and better agents\u201D are on the
        way, predicts Time.[1] \u201CAutonomous \u2018agents\u2019 and profitability
        are likely to dominate the artificial intelligence agenda,\u201D reports Reuters.[2]
        \u201CThe age of agentic AI has arrived,\u201D promises Forbes, in response
        to a claim from Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang.[3] \\nTech media is awash with
        assurances that our lives are on the verge of a total transformation. Autonomous
        agents are poised to streamline and alter our jobs, drive optimization and
        accompany us in our daily lives, handling our mundanities in real time and
        freeing us up for creative pursuits and other higher-level tasks.\\n### 2025
        as the year of agentic exploration\\n\u201CIBM and Morning Consult did a survey
        of 1,000 developers who are building AI applications for enterprise, and 99%
        of them said they are exploring or developing AI agents,\u201D\_explains Ashoori.
        \u201CSo yes, the answer is that 2025 is going to be the year of the agent.\u201D
        However, that declaration is not without nuance.\\nAfter establishing the
        current market conception of agents as LLMs with function calling, Ashoori
        draws a distinction between that idea and truly autonomous agents. \u201CThe
        true definition [of an AI agent] is an intelligent entity with reasoning and
        planning capabilities that can autonomously take action. Those reasoning and
        planning capabilities are up for discussion. It depends on how you define
        that.\u201D\\n\u201CI definitely see AI agents heading in this direction,
        but we\u2019re not fully there yet,\u201D says Gajjar. \u201CRight now, we\u2019re
        seeing early glimpses\u2014AI agents can already analyze data, predict trends
        and automate workflows to some extent. But building AI agents that can autonomously
        handle complex decision-making will take more than just better algorithms.
        We\u2019ll need big leaps in contextual reasoning and testing for edge cases,\u201D
        she adds.\\nDanilevsky isn\u2019t convinced that this is anything new. \u201CI&#39;m
        still struggling to truly believe that this is all that different from just
        orchestration,\u201D she says. \u201CYou&#39;ve renamed orchestration, but
        now it&#39;s called agents, because that&#39;s the cool word. But orchestration
        is something that we&#39;ve been doing in programming forever.\u201D\\nWith
        regard to 2025 being the year of the agent, Danilevsky is skeptical. \u201CIt
        depends on what you say an agent is, what you think an agent is going to accomplish
        and what kind of value you think it will bring,\u201D she says. \u201CIt&#39;s
        quite a statement to make when we haven&#39;t even yet figured out ROI (return
        on investment) on LLM technology more generally.\u201D\\nAnd it\u2019s not
        just the business side that has her hedging her bets. \u201CThere&#39;s the
        hype of imagining if this thing could think for you and make all these decisions
        and take actions on your computer. Realistically, that&#39;s terrifying.\u201D\\nDanilevsky
        frames the disconnect as one of miscommunication. \u201C[Agents] tend to be
        very ineffective because humans are very bad communicators. We still can&#39;t
        get chat agents to interpret what you want correctly all the time.\u201D\\nStill,
        the forthcoming year holds a lot of promise as an era of experimentation.
        \u201CI&#39;m a big believer in [2025 as the year of the agent],\u201D says
        Hay excitedly.\\nEvery large tech company and hundreds of startups are now
        experimenting with agents. Salesforce, for example, has released their Agentforce
        platform, which enables users to create agents that are easily integrated
        within the Salesforce app ecosystem.\\n\u201CThe wave is coming and we&#39;re
        going to have a lot of agents. It&#39;s still a very nascent ecosystem, so
        I think a lot of people are going to build agents, and they&#39;re going to
        have a lot of fun.\u201D\\n## Narrative 2: Agents can handle highly complex
        tasks on their own\\nThis narrative assumes that today\u2019s agents meet
        the theoretical definition outlined in the introduction to this piece. 2025\u2019s
        agents will be fully autonomous AI programs that can scope out a project and
        complete it with all the necessary tools they need and with no help from human
        partners. But what\u2019s missing from this narrative is nuance.\\n### Today\u2019s
        models are more than enough\\nHay believes that the groundwork has already
        been laid for such developments. \u201CThe big thing about agents is that
        they have the ability to plan,\u201D he outlines. \u201CThey have the ability
        to reason, to use tools and perform tasks, and they need to do it at speed
        and scale.\u201D\\nHe cites 4 developments that, compared to the best models
        of 12 to 18 months ago, mean that the models of early 2025 can power the agents
        envisioned by the proponents of this narrative:\\n* Better, faster, smaller
        models\\n* Chain-of-thought (COT) training\\n* Increased context windows\\n*
        Function calling\\n\u201CNow, most of these things are in play,\u201D Hay
        continues. \u201CYou can have the AI call tools. It can plan. It can reason
        and come back with good answers. It can use inference-time compute. You\u2019ll
        have better chains of thought and more memory to work with. It&#39;s going
        to run fast. It\u2019s going to be cheap. That leads you to a structure where
        I think you can have agents. The models are improving and they&#39;re getting
        better, so that&#39;s only going to accelerate.\u201D\\n### Realistic expectations
        are a must\\nAshoori is careful to differentiate between what agents will
        be able to do later, and what they can do now. \u201CThere is the promise,
        and there is what the agent&#39;s capable of doing today,\u201D she says.
        \u201CI would say the answer depends on the use case. For simple use cases,
        the agents are capable of [choosing the correct tool], but for more sophisticated
        use cases, the technology\",\"image\":\"https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/gbs/cf/ul/g/5a/88/336.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.1280.1280.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/adobe-cms/default-images/icon-32x32.png\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhRJsjr-I3I\",\"title\":\"AWS

        Author\\n##### **\\nAlexander Zagnetko\\n***Manager,*Process Organization
        and Improvement\\n[Contact us for more information] \\n#### From Generative
        to Agentic AI\\nOver the past five years, we\u2019ve witnessed a dramatic
        leap in AI capabilities. From the launch of GPT-3 in 2020 to the widespread
        adoption of models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini between 2023 and 2024, generative
        AI has already revolutionized numerous industries. But as impressive as these
        developments are, they represent just the beginning of a much broader transformation.\\nThe
        next major milestone is the rise of autonomous agents\u2014systems that can
        now carry out complex workflows and collaborate with humans or other agents.
        These systems set their own goals, plan their actions, use tools, and adapt
        to changing conditions. Unlike traditional AI agents designed for narrow,
        specific tasks, agentic AI systems operate with much greater independence.
        They are built to:\\n* Perceive their environment through both structured
        and unstructured data,\\n* Plan actions using logic and decision-making frameworks,\\n*
        Execute tasks using tools, APIs, or physical devices,\\n* Learn from feedback
        and improve over time,\\n* Collaborate with humans and other agents.\\nThe
        shift from generative to agentic AI marks a fundamental leap in artificial
        intelligence. It stems from the integration of multiple capabilities: large
        language models (LLMs), memory systems, planning algorithms, tool integration,
        and multi-agent coordination. Together, these elements enable AI systems to
        function as digital workers\u2014capable of performing tasks that once required
        human judgment and coordination. Agentic AI is opening up entirely new possibilities
        and will have a profound impact on business strategy, organizational design,
        and competitive advantage.\\n#### Technical Foundations of Agentic AI\\nAgAI
        systems are built on a layered architecture that combines several advanced
        technologies. Let\u2019s break down the core components. At the heart of most
        agentic systems is a**large language model (LLM)**such as GPT-4, Claude, or
        Gemini. These models are trained on massive datasets and can understand and
        generate human-like language. They provide the linguistic and reasoning capabilities
        that underpin agent behaviour. Unlike traditional chatbots, agentic systems
        need to**remember past interactions**, decisions, and outcomes. Memory enables
        agents to learn from experience, personalize interactions, and maintain continuity
        over time.\\nFor agents to act autonomously, they must be able to plan several
        steps ahead and consider the consequences of their decisions. This is why
        they combine reasoning with tool use\u2014a method known as ReAct (Reasoning
        &#43; Acting)\u2014and explore multiple logical pathways before choosing a
        course of action, a technique referred to as Tree-of-Thoughts. Another well-known
        approach to evaluating potential actions is Monte Carlo Tree Search, originally
        developed for game-playing AI. These techniques enable agents to break down
        complex goals into manageable tasks and respond flexibly to feedback.\\nAs
        agents become more autonomous, ensuring their responsible and ethical behavior
        becomes increasingly important. This is essential for building trust and deploying
        agentic AI in a safe and accountable way. Key mechanisms include:\\n* **Human-in-the-loop**\u2013
        giving humans the ability to approve or override an agent\u2019s decisions.\\n*
        **Audit trails**\u2013 tracking the agent\u2019s actions to ensure accountability.\\n*
        **Ethical constraints**\u2013 rules that prevent harmful or unethical behavior.\\n*
        **Value alignment**\u2013 ensuring agents act in accordance with human values.\\n####
        AI Agents as the New Digital Workforce\\nAgentic AI is opening up new possibilities
        for businesses in terms of efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Whether
        it\u2019s automating routine tasks or orchestrating complex workflows, agentic
        AI is finding broad applications across sectors\u2014from financial services
        and healthcare to education, retail, and software development.\\naccount\\\\_balance\\\\_wallet##
        Financial Services\\nThe financial sector has long been a frontrunner in AI
        adoption, and agentic AI takes automation to the next level. Autonomous agents
        can monitor market conditions in real time, assess risks, and execute trades
        with minimal human oversight. They continuously scan transactions for suspicious
        activity, track regulatory updates, and ensure compliance. In customer service
        and advisory roles, agents analyze client data and recommend tailored financial
        products, effectively acting as digital financial advisors.\\nmedical\\\\_services##
        Healthcare\\nHealthcare is one of the most complex and data-intensive sectors,
        making it a natural fit for agentic AI. Agents can analyze medical records,
        test results, and imaging data, flag potential drug interactions, suggest
        additional diagnostics, and assist with documentation. They also coordinate
        care by scheduling appointments, managing referrals, and reducing redundancies.
        On the administrative side, agents streamline tasks like billing, claims processing,
        and regulatory compliance, allowing medical professionals to focus more on
        patient care.\\ngavel## Legal and Compliance\\nThe legal sector is undergoing
        a major transformation thanks to agentic AI. Autonomous agents can read, interpret,
        and generate legal documents, analyze contracts, highlight key clauses, flag
        risks, suggest edits, and draft standard agreements based on templates and
        client requirements. They also monitor regulatory changes across jurisdictions,
        evaluate their impact, and recommend compliance actions. In litigation, they
        assist with legal research, summarizing precedents, and preparing arguments.\\ncast\\\\_for\\\\_education##
        Education and Training\\nDigital transformation has reached education as well.
        AI agents serve as interactive tutors, answering questions in real time, providing
        feedback, and adapting to individual learning styles. They can even detect
        emotional cues to offer support when motivation is low. In assessments, agents
        automatically grade assignments, generate tests, and provide detailed feedback,
        while identifying performance trends and recommending timely interventions.\\nstorefront##
        Retail and E-commerce\\nIn the retail sector, companies use agentic AI to
        enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and boost sales. In logistics,
        agents forecast demand, manage inventory, coordinate with suppliers, and respond
        to market changes in real time\u2014for example, by rerouting deliveries or
        adjusting pricing. In marketing, they design targeted campaigns, segment audiences,
        and optimize content, improving product placement and promotional strategies
        based on customer behavior.\\nwebhook## Software Development\\nAgentic AI
        is also revolutionizing the entire software development lifecycle\u2014from
        design to deployment. Agents can generate code from natural language, detect
        and fix bugs, optimize performance, and create documentation and tests. In
        product management, they gather user feedback, prioritize features, draft
        specifications, and coordinate team collaboration, accelerating innovation
        and improving product quality.\\n#### Speed of Implementation Is the Competitive
        Advantage\\nAgentic AI is not just about boosting efficiency\u2014it\u2019s
        a fundamental shift in how companies operate, make decisions, and create value.
        By combining large language models, memory systems, planning algorithms, and
        the ability to interact with external tools, agentic AI becomes an active
        participant in business processes. Its impact goes beyond any single department\u2014it\u2019s
        transforming entire industries, from finance and healthcare to software development.\\nOrganizations
        that understand and implement this technology early will gain a competitive
        edge\u2014not only through speed and precision but also through their ability
        to respond to market changes, personalize services, and innovate faster than
        ever before.\\n## Contact our experts\\nShould you wish more information on

        intelligence, 2025 marked a decisive shift. Systems once confined to research
        labs and prototypes began to appear as everyday tools. At the center of this
        transition was the rise of AI agents \u2013AI systems that can use other software
        tools and act on their own.\\nWhile researchers have studied AI for more than
        60 years, and the term \u201Cagent\u201D has long been part of the field\u2019s
        vocabulary, 2025 was the year the concept became concrete for developers and
        consumers alike.\\nAI agents moved from theory to infrastructure, reshaping
        how people interact with large language models, the systems that power chatbots
        like ChatGPT.\\nIn 2025, the definition of AI agent shifted from the[academic
        framing] of systems that perceive, reason and act to AI company[Anthropic\u2019s
        description] of large language models that are capable of using software tools
        and taking autonomous action. While large language models have long excelled
        at text-based responses, the recent change is their expanding capacity to
        act, using tools, calling[APIs], coordinating with other systems and completing
        tasks independently.\\nThis shift did not happen overnight. A key inflection
        point came in late 2024, when Anthropic released the[Model Context Protocol].
        The protocol allowed developers to connect large language models to external
        tools in a standardized way, effectively giving models the ability to act
        beyond generating text. With that, the stage was set for 2025 to become the
        year of AI agents.\\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \\nAI agents are a whole
        new ballgame compared with generative AI.## The milestones that defined 2025\\nThe
        momentum accelerated quickly. In January, the release of Chinese model[DeepSeek-R1]
        as an[open-weight] model disrupted assumptions about who could build high-performing
        large language models, briefly rattling markets and intensifying global competition.
        An open-weight model is an AI model whose training, reflected in values called
        weights, is publicly available. Throughout 2025, major U.S. labs such as[OpenAI],[Anthropic],[Google]
        and[xAI] released larger, high-performance models, while Chinese tech companies
        including[Alibaba],[Tencent], and[DeepSeek] expanded the open-model ecosystem
        to the point where the Chinese models have been[downloaded more than American
        models].\\n##### Another turning point came in April, when Google introduced
        its[Agent2Agent protocol]. While Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol focused
        on how agents use tools, Agent2Agent addressed how agents communicate with
        each other. Crucially, the two protocols were designed to work together. Later
        in the year, both[Anthropic] and[Google] donated their protocols to the open-source
        software nonprofit Linux Foundation, cementing them as open standards rather
        than proprietary experiments.\\nThese developments quickly found their way
        into consumer products. By mid-2025, \u201Cagentic browsers\u201D began to
        appear. Tools such as[Perplexity\u2019s Comet],[Browser Company\u2019s Dia],[OpenAI\u2019s
        GPT Atlas],[Copilot in Microsoft\u2019s Edge],[ASI X Inc.\u2019s Fellou],[MainFunc.ai\u2019s
        Genspark],[Opera\u2019s Opera Neon] and others reframed the browser as an
        active participant rather than a passive interface. For example, rather than
        helping you search for vacation details, it plays a part in booking the vacation.\\nAt
        the same time, workflow builders like[n8n] and[Google\u2019s Antigravity]
        lowered the technical barrier for creating custom agent systems beyond what
        has already happened with coding agents like[Cursor] and[GitHub Copilot].\\n##
        New power, new risks\\nAs agents became more capable, their risks became harder
        to ignore. In November, Anthropic disclosed how its Claude Code agent[had
        been misused] to automate parts of a cyberattack. The incident illustrated
        a broader concern: By automating repetitive, technical work, AI agents can
        also lower the barrier for malicious activity.\\nThis tension defined much
        of 2025. AI agents expanded what individuals and organizations could do, but
        they also[amplified existing vulnerabilities]. Systems that were once isolated
        text generators became interconnected, tool-using actors operating with little
        human oversight.\\n[![Embedded YouTube video]] \\nThe business community is
        gearing up for multiagent systems.## What to watch for in 2026\\nLooking ahead,
        several open questions are likely to shape the next phase of AI agents.\\nOne
        is benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks, which are like a structured exam with
        a series of questions and standardized scoring, work well for single models,
        but[agents are composite systems] made up of models, tools, memory and decision
        logic. Researchers increasingly want to evaluate[not just outcomes, but processes].
        This would be like asking students to show their work, not just provide an
        answer.\\nProgress here will be critical for improving reliability and trust,
        and ensuring that an AI agent will perform the task at hand. One method is
        establishing clear definitions around[AI agents and AI workflows]. Organizations
        will need to map out exactly where AI will[integrate into workflows or introduce
        new ones].\\nAnother development to watch is governance. In late 2025, the
        Linux Foundation announced the creation of the[Agentic AI Foundation], signaling
        an effort to establish shared standards and best practices. If successful,
        it could play a role like the[World Wide Web Consortium] in shaping an open,
        interoperable agent ecosystem.\\nThere is also a growing debate over model
        size. While large, general-purpose models dominate headlines, smaller and
        more specialized models are often[better suited to specific tasks]. As agents
        become configurable consumer and business tools, whether through browsers
        or workflow management software, the power to choose the right model increasingly
        shifts to users rather than labs or corporations.\\n## The challenges ahead\\nDespite
        the optimism, significant socio-technical challenges remain. Expanding data
        center infrastructure[strains energy grids] and affects local communities.
        In workplaces, agents raise concerns about automation,[job displacement] and
        surveillance.\\nFrom a security perspective, connecting models to tools and
        stacking agents together[multiplies risks] that are already unresolved in
        standalone large language models. Specifically, AI practitioners are addressing
        the dangers of[indirect prompt injections], where prompts are hidden in open
        web spaces that are readable by AI agents and result in harmful or unintended
        actions.\\nRegulation is another unresolved issue. Compared with[Europe] and[China],
        the United States has relatively limited oversight of algorithmic systems.
        As AI agents become embedded across digital life, questions about access,
        accountability and limits remain largely unanswered.\\nMeeting these challenges
        will require more than technical breakthroughs. It demands[rigorous engineering
        practices], careful design and clear documentation of how systems work and
        fail. Only by treating AI agents as socio-technical systems rather than mere
        software components, I believe, can we build an AI ecosystem that is both
        innovative and safe.\\n**\\n* [Artificial intelligence (AI)] \\n* [Google]

        \\n[FAQs] \\n#### Introduction\\nSoftware development is entering a new era
        where artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t just assist developers, but actively
        builds, tests, and improves applications on its own.\\nIn 2025, this evolution
        is being led by a new class of intelligent systems known as Agentic AI &#8211;
        autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and taking actions
        independently. Unlike traditional AI tools that require constant human input,
        Agentic AI can analyze goals, make decisions, and execute tasks end-to-end
        transforming how businesses create and manage software.\\nFor years, companies
        have struggled with familiar challenges:\\n* Slow development cycles that
        delay releases.\\n* Rising engineering costs with limited resources.\\n* Complex
        integrations across legacy systems.\\n* Dependency on manual processes that
        limit scalability.\\nAgentic AI changes this dynamic. These intelligent agents
        can automate entire parts of the development lifecycle from writing and reviewing
        code to running tests and deploying updates, freeing teams to focus on innovation
        rather than repetitive work.\\nAs a result, organizations adopting Agentic
        AI aren\u2019t just accelerating development speed; they\u2019re reimagining
        what software teams can achieve with autonomous systems that think, act, and
        learn continuously.\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore how Agentic AI is transforming
        software development in 2025, the real-world impact it\u2019s already making,
        and how businesses can strategically implement it to gain a long-term competitive
        edge.\\n#### What Is Agentic AI and How Does It Work?\\nBefore diving into
        how Agentic AI is transforming software development, it\u2019s important to
        understand what it actually is and why it\u2019s considered the next major
        leap in[artificial intelligence].\\nAgentic AI refers to a new generation
        of autonomous AI systems that can perceive information, reason through objectives,
        and take actions independently all without requiring continuous human instructions.
        Unlike traditional AI tools that respond to commands or prompts, Agentic AI
        Agents operate based on goals. They can interpret context, plan tasks, make
        decisions, and execute actions on their own much like how a skilled developer
        might handle an assignment from start to finish.\\n##### How Agentic AI Works\\nAgentic
        AI works through a continuous cognitive loop that mirrors human-like thinking.
        Each agent follows a process of perception, reasoning, action, and reflection,
        enabling it to learn and improve over time.\\nHere\u2019s how this plays out
        in practice:\\n* **Perception:**The AI Agent gathers context such as project
        requirements, past code commits, or bug reports from connected systems.\\n*
        **Reasoning:**It analyzes this information using its internal logic, memory,
        and large language models to determine the best next steps.\\n* **Action:**The
        agent performs the required tasks like generating code, testing modules, or
        deploying builds through integrated tools or APIs.\\n* **Reflection:**It evaluates
        the outcome, identifies what worked or failed, and refines its next decisions
        accordingly.\\n##### How Agentic AI Differs from Traditional AI\\nTraditional
        AI models are reactive, they provide answers when prompted. In contrast, Agentic
        AI is proactive. It acts on defined goals, manages tasks across multiple systems,
        and even collaborates with other AI agents to complete larger objectives.\\nFor
        instance, while a conventional AI coding assistant can help generate snippets
        of code, an Agentic AI system can oversee the entire process from analyzing
        requirements to writing, testing, and deploying code autonomously.\\nThis
        shift marks the beginning of AI-driven software ecosystems where intelligent
        agents work alongside human teams to optimize speed, quality, and scalability.\\nTo
        understand**what Agentic AI is, how it functions, and the complete lifecycle
        of an AI agent**, read our detailed guide here:[**What Is Agentic AI? A Complete
        Guide to Its Lifecycle and Functions**].\\n#### How Autonomous AI Agents Are
        Transforming Software Development in 2025\\nSoftware development has always
        been about collaboration of designers, developers, testers, and project managers
        working together to bring an idea to life. But in 2025, a new kind of collaborator
        has joined the team:**Autonomous AI Agents**.\\nThese intelligent, self-operating
        AI systems go beyond simple automation. They understand objectives, make independent
        decisions, and execute end-to-end workflows within the[software development
        lifecycle] (SDLC) transforming how modern teams plan, build, test, and deploy
        software.\\nLet\u2019s explore how Agentic AI is reshaping every stage of
        development:\\n1. **Planning and Requirement Analysis**\\nIn traditional software
        planning, teams spend extensive time gathering requirements, analyzing dependencies,
        and setting milestones. Agentic AI accelerates this process through intelligent
        automation.\\nAI Agents can read documentation, project briefs, and performance
        data to extract accurate requirements automatically. They detect dependencies,
        forecast development timelines, and assess risks using real-time data insights.\\nBy
        leveraging AI-driven project analysis, businesses gain faster planning cycles,
        better decision-making, and improved resource utilization &#8211; all key
        to delivering successful, high-quality products.\\n2. **Code Generation and
        Review**\\nThe coding stage is where autonomous AI Agents truly revolutionize
        AI software development. Unlike basic AI coding assistants, these agents can
        generate entire modules, optimize logic, and ensure adherence to industry
        standards.\\nThey interpret requirements, create efficient algorithms, and
        perform automated code reviews to identify syntax errors, security gaps, or
        performance bottlenecks. This not only enhances code quality but also reduces
        development time and human dependency.\\nBy integrating AI-powered code generation
        and validation, development teams achieve faster release cycles, improved
        maintainability, and greater consistency across projects.\\n3. **Testing and
        Quality Assurance**\\nAI in software testing has evolved dramatically with
        the rise of Agentic AI. Instead of relying on manual QA teams, AI Agents autonomously
        execute testing workflows from creating test cases to identifying and fixing
        bugs.\\nThese agents continuously learn from past results, improving their
        accuracy and predicting potential failures before they occur. They validate
        builds, monitor regression, and ensure that every release meets high performance
        and reliability standards.\\nThe outcome: shorter testing cycles, higher accuracy,
        and more stable software deployments.\\n4. **Deployment and CI/CD Automation**\\nDeployment
        is one of the most complex and time-sensitive stages of software delivery.
        Autonomous AI agents simplify this through end-to-end[CI/CD automation.] \\nThey
        integrate seamlessly with DevOps pipelines, handling build management, environment
        setup, and deployment tasks with precision. During live deployments, AI Agents
        monitor performance, detect anomalies, and automatically roll back faulty
        builds ensuring zero downtime and continuous delivery stability.\\nThis creates
        a self-managing DevOps ecosystem that enhances release reliability and operational
        efficiency.\\n5. **Continuous Improvement and Maintenance**\\nWith Agentic
        AI, software maintenance transforms from a reactive task into a proactive,
        self-optimizing process.\\nAI agents constantly monitor application performance,
        analyze user behavior, and identify inefficiencies in real time. They recommend
        performance optimizations, manage dependency updates, and even handle minor
        issue resolutions autonomously.\\nThis continuous learning loop ensures that
        your systems evolve intelligently improving scalability, stability, and efficiency
        over time without manual intervention.\\nBy adopting Agentic AI solutions,
        organizations move beyond static automation into a new era of AI-driven software
        development where every stage of the lifecycle is optimized, intelligent,
        and self-improving.\\n[SculptSoft], a trusted custom AI software development
        company, helps enterprises implement these autonomous AI systems to accelerate
        innovation, reduce time-to-market, and achieve higher-quality outcomes in
        2025 and beyond.\\n#### Key Benefits of Agentic AI in Software Development\\nAgentic
        AI is transforming software development from a manual, time-consuming process
        into a dynamic, intelligent workflow driven by autonomous AI Agents. These
        systems don\u2019t just assist developers, they think, plan, and act on their
        own, making development faster, smarter, and more efficient.\\nLet\u2019s

        autonomous AI agents represents a transformative leap in the evolution of
        artificial intelligence. These intelligent systems, capable of independently
        perceiving environments, making decisions, learning from experience, and executing
        multi-step actions without continuous human oversight, are redefining the
        boundaries of what machines can accomplish. Unlike traditional rule-based
        or supervised AI systems, autonomous agents integrate deep learning, reinforcement
        learning, natural language processing, and multi-modal decision frameworks
        to solve complex, dynamic, and often ambiguous real-world problems. This paper
        explores the technological underpinnings, capabilities, applications, and
        implications of autonomous AI agents. It critically examines their deployment
        in sectors such as healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, logistics, manufacturing,
        education, and scientific research. Furthermore, it addresses the ethical,
        legal, and socio-technical challenges arising from the increasing autonomy
        of machines, offering a roadmap for responsible innovation. Ultimately, autonomous
        AI agents are not merely tools\u2014they are collaborators in a new era of

        \\n## **Executive Summary**\\nThe first quarter of 2025 marked a period of
        intense activity and significant evolution in the field of Artificial Intelligence
        (AI) agents.\\n* Characterized by a**rapid transition from research concepts
        to tangible products**, this timeframe solidified the notion of 2025 as a
        pivotal \\\"year of the agent,\\\" albeit one accompanied by considerable
        hype and persistent challenges. (1)\\n* The definition of**AI agents increasingly
        centered on systems, typically built upon Large Language Models (LLMs)**,
        capable of autonomous task execution through planning, reasoning, and the
        crucial ability to utilize external tools. (4)\\n* **Major technology companies,
        including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, and Meta, accelerated the
        push towards commercialization**, unveiling a suite of new agent platforms,
        specialized agents targeting specific workflows (e.g., software development,
        sales, security, research), and underlying infrastructure components. (7)\\n*
        **Research simultaneously advanced**, focusing on enhancing core capabilities
        like reasoning, fostering human-AI collaboration, and developing multi-agent
        systems (MAS) capable of complex interactions. (12)\\n* Concurrently,**the
        discourse surrounding the challenges, limitations, and ethical implications
        intensified**. Concerns regarding reliability, safety, control, bias, and
        privacy became more prominent as agent autonomy increased, prompting calls
        for robust governance frameworks and dedicated agent infrastructure. (16)\\n*
        While the potential for AI agents to automate tasks and augment human capabilities
        is increasingly evident,**significant hurdles in achieving dependable, safe,
        and ethically aligned performance remained a primary focus**for the industry
        moving forward. (20)\\n## **Defining the AI Agent Landscape (Early 2025)**\\n###
        **Conceptual Evolution and Definitions**\\nThe understanding and definition
        of AI agents underwent a notable transformation leading into early 2025, largely
        catalyzed by advancements in LLMs. Historically, the concept of an agent was
        rooted in computer science and cognitive science, often defined broadly as
        anything capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting
        upon it through actuators. Early work emphasized properties like autonomy,
        social ability, reactivity, and proactivity. (4)\\nHowever, by the first quarter
        of 2025, the prevailing conceptualization became intrinsically linked to the
        capabilities offered by modern LLMs. (4)\\nWhile no single, universally accepted
        definition existed (24), a strong consensus emerged viewing AI agents as systems
        or programs capable of*autonomously performing tasks*on behalf of a user or
        another system. This autonomy involved designing their own workflows and utilizing
        available tools to achieve specified goals. (1)\\nThis modern understanding
        clearly differentiated AI agents from simpler AI applications like chatbots
        or traditional automation. Unlike chatbots primarily focused on conversational
        responses based on pre-existing data (6), or traditional systems executing
        predefined algorithms within constraints (4), early 2025 agents were characterized
        by their ability to plan, reason, learn, and interact dynamically with their
        environment to accomplish complex, often multi-step objectives. (4) They leveraged
        LLMs as core reasoning or processing components but augmented them with essential
        capabilities like memory, planning modules, and mechanisms for tool use. (4)
        This augmentation was crucial, addressing inherent LLM limitations such as
        statelessness (lack of memory between interactions) and the inability to directly
        interact with or affect the external world. (17) The term \\\"agentic AI\\\"
        also gained traction, often referring to systems composed of multiple, potentially
        collaborative, AI agents working towards a common objective. (28)\\nThe evolution
        of the definition directly mirrors the enabling power of LLMs. While the theoretical
        foundations of agency existed for decades (4), the practical ability of LLMs
        to understand complex instructions, reason about tasks, and generate plausible
        action steps provided the foundation for building agents that could move beyond
        theoretical constructs and execute tasks in the real world (primarily digital
        environments). The focus shifted from defining agency based on abstract properties
        to defining it based on the functional capabilities enabled by integrating
        LLMs with planning, memory, and tool-using mechanisms. This practical turn,
        driven by LLM advancements, underpins the surge in agent development and deployment
        observed in early 2025.\\n### **Core Capabilities**\\nThe AI agents emerging
        in early 2025 were defined by a set of core capabilities that enabled their
        autonomous and goal-directed behavior. These capabilities, often working in
        concert and built upon LLM foundations, distinguished them from prior AI systems:\\n*
        **Autonomy:**This was perhaps the most central characteristic. Agents were
        expected to operate with minimal human intervention or continuous oversight,
        capable of initiating and completing tasks independently.1 The degree of autonomy
        existed on a spectrum. Some systems were semi-autonomous, requiring human
        oversight for critical decisions (26), while others aimed for, or raised concerns
        about, higher levels of autonomy, potentially even \\\"fully autonomous\\\"
        operation where agents could act without predefined constraints, a prospect
        met with significant safety concerns. (18)\\n* **Learning &amp; Adaptation:**Agents
        were designed to improve their performance over time. This involved learning
        from environmental feedback, past interactions, and accumulated experience.3
        Mechanisms like reinforcement learning allowed agents to refine strategies
        based on outcomes. (26) The ability to self-evaluate and correct errors was
        also highlighted. (32) Memory, both short-term (for maintaining context within
        a task) and long-term (for retaining historical data and preferences), was
        crucial for adaptation and personalization. (26)\\n* **Reasoning &amp; Decision-Making:**Agents
        needed to process perceived information, analyze data, make judgments, and
        select appropriate actions to achieve their goals. (1) LLMs often served as
        the core \\\"reasoning engine\\\" (32), interpreting inputs and generating
        potential action plans. The period saw the emergence of specialized models
        explicitly optimized for reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance agent decision-making
        capabilities. (12)\\n* **Interaction:**Agents were defined by their ability
        to engage with their environment. This involved perception \u2013gathering
        information through various inputs like text, voice, images, sensors, data
        feeds, or APIs (1) \u2013and action \u2013influencing the environment through
        outputs like generating text, sending commands to software, executing code,
        or making API calls. (1) Crucially, this interaction extended beyond simple
        user dialogue to include engagement with external systems, tools, data sources,
        and potentially other agents or humans. (1)\\n* **Planning &amp; Goal-Directedness:**Agents
        were designed to be proactive and goal-oriented. (24) This required the ability
        to understand a high-level objective, decompose it into smaller, manageable
        steps (task decomposition), formulate a sequence of actions (planning), and
        then execute that plan. (5) The capability for long-term planning, reasoning
        about extended sequences of actions, was also an area of development and concern.
        (12)\\n* **Tool Usage:**A key enabler of agent functionality was the ability
        to utilize external tools. These could include APIs for accessing external
        services (like weather data, booking systems, or databases), web search capabilities,
        code interpreters, calculators, or even invoking other AI models or agents.
        (4) Tool use allowed agents to overcome the inherent limitations of their
        base LLMs (e.g., accessing real-time information, performing precise calculations,
        interacting with specific software) and act effectively in the environment.
        (6)\\nThe confluence of these capabilities defined the ambition for AI agents
        in early 2025. The objective was clear: to transition AI from being passive
        responders or pattern recognizers to becoming active, autonomous participants
        capable of understanding goals, formulating plans, interacting with the digital
        world through tools, learning from outcomes, and ultimately achieving complex
        objectives with reduced human guidance. This represented a significant functional
        leap, enabling the automation of tasks previously requiring human cognition
        and intervention.\\n### **C. Agent Architectures and Components**\\nThe design
        of AI agents in early 2025 commonly followed specific architectural patterns,
        reflecting attempts to harness the power of LLMs while mitigating their weaknesses.
        Agents were frequently described as*compound systems*. (24) This meant they
        were not monolithic entities but rather architectures built around a foundation
        model (typically an LLM) augmented by external resources or modules, often
        referred to as \\\"scaffolding\\\". (5) This scaffolding provided capabilities
        the base LLM lacked, such as persistent memory, structured planning, and interfaces

        11, 2025\\nShare\\n* [\\n] \\n* [\\n] \\n* [\\n] \\n#### KEY POINTS\\n* **Agentic
        AI is revolutionizing construction by enabling autonomous systems to plan,
        monitor, and update tasks, offering multi-step reasoning and decision-making
        beyond traditional AI workflows and Large Language Models (LLMs).**\\n* **Tools
        simplify software development by generating, modifying, and testing code from
        written requirements, reducing manual coding time and empowering non-coders
        to create apps and automations.**\\n* **While agentic AI accelerates innovation,
        one expert suggested that users must maintain a \u201Chuman in the loop.\u201D**\\nWhat
        a difference a year makes in the world of[construction tech].\\nDelegates
        attending day two of the recent Buildings Show in Toronto heard how agentic
        AI is rapidly emerging as construction\u2019s third wave of[AI], moving beyond
        Large Language Models (LLMs) and[automated workflows] to create a world of
        autonomous systems that plan, monitor, and update[project tasks], as well
        aswrite code.\\nDigital innovation specialist Mahir Dheendsa of[Amrize] (formerly
        Lafarge), host of a session titled \u201CAI Agents and the Robotic Workforce:
        Reimagining the Future of Construction,\u201Dsaid the use of agentic AI is
        accelerating. So rapidly that the preview of the session he wrote for the
        show program months ago was already out of date.\\n![DW-buildings-show-AI-agencyweb]
        \\nDigital innovation specialist Mahir Dheendsa of Amrize spoke about AI agents
        at the Buildings Show in Toronto, Dec. 4. Dheendsa took a moment to outline
        how Amrize represents the new brand for Lafarge. Image: Don Wall\\n\u201CAgentic
        AI has been the talk of the town and the major headline in the AI space this
        year,\u201D said Dheendsa. \u201CWe haven\u2019t really seen any major advancements
        in robotics, so I\u2019m willing to sort of skip over that.\u201D\\nPlatforms
        offering AI agents, such as n8n, Gemini Agent Studio, Make.com and Zapier,
        democratize agent development, Dheendsa said, enabling[construction professionals]
        to build custom automations without extensive coding expertise.\\nGenerative
        development tools like Lovable AI and Cursor take it a step further by generating,
        modifying, and testing software directly from written requirements, dramatically[reducing
        the time] typically spent on planning and manual coding.\\n[![Econ Ads_Banners3.jpg.-2]]
        \\n#### Multi-Step Reasoning\\nLLMs offer a single-step response with no tools
        or actions, he explained. AI workflows follow a fixed sequence of steps and
        can connect multiple apps, but with no reasoning or judgment. An AI agent
        acts as autonomous intelligence, utilizing multi-step reasoning and tools
        and APIs to evaluate, retry, and create.\\nDheendsa offered an example of
        a supply chain coordination function with a problem: a crew of 20 is standing
        around doing nothing because the steel beams haven\u2019t arrived.\\nThe agent
        can track supplier GPS data and manufacturing status updates in real-time,
        potentially predicting a delay three days in advance and suggesting rescheduling
        the crane rental.\\nAnother example is with a change order. A[subcontractor]
        might send bills for \u201Cextra work,\u201D and nobody remembers if it was
        approved, said Dheendsa. The agent scans thousands of emails, contracts, and
        meeting minutes automatically and verifies if the extra work was actually
        part of the original contract scope.\\n\u201CAn AI agent has the ability to
        make decisions,\u201D said Dheendsa. \u201CThe[AI agent] monitors and reports.
        It will detect an issue, and it will decide if this is an issue worthy of
        being brought up based on a criteria that you can provide it.\\n\u201CAnd
        then it will figure out which team or which person needs to be notified.\u201D\\nHe
        has used Replit, Lovable, and Cursor, and all can work to generate responses
        to RFPs, he said.\\n\u201CYou just copy the[RFP] into the Lovable app, and
        the software is done,\u201D said Dheendsa.\\n\u201CIf you have an idea, if
        you want to build an app, you don\u2019t even need to know how to code. You
        just put your idea in there, and it\u2019ll just generate you an app or a
        web app, website, whatever you need.\u201D\\nHuman in the Loop\\nDheendsa
        stressed that users still need to keep a \u201Chuman in the loop.\u201D\\n\u201CIt
        is prone to making mistakes. It is prone to hallucinations, (but) it\u2019s
        getting better.\u201D\\nWith Gemini 3, for example, \u201CI\u2019d say it\u2019s
        85 per cent there. It\u2019s very good.\u201D\\nAnother caveat is that users
        should not venture into AI solutions if the original process is flawed: \u201CDon\u2019t
        automate broken processes,\u201D Dheendsa said.\\nAmong various risks he identified,
        \u201Cover-trust risk\u201D is highly dangerous, he said. Al confidence does
        not equal correctness. Always verify technical outputs and cross-check against
        standards and codes, he said.\\nMicrosoft has reported[construction jobs]
        in the field are among the least threatened by AI, Dheendsa noted in an interview,
        for a couple of reasons.\\nFor one, dredge operators or crane operators represent
        a lot of \u201Cmoving parts.\u201D Second, he said, there hasn\u2019t been
        enough data collected in the field for[AI to automate].\\n\u201CThe low-hanging
        fruit is here with the administrative stuff, like data entry and all the[repetitive
        workflows]. So let\u2019s just start there,\u201D said Dheendsa.\\n\u201CThe
        barrier to entry is lower than ever before\u2026I encourage people to start
        doing that, because even if it\u2019s not going to get you 100 per cent of
        the way there, it\u2019ll at least get you 80 per cent.\u201D\\n#### About

        > > Abstract:\\n> This technical brief introduces Deep Agent, an advanced
        autonomous AI system designed to manage complex multi-phase tasks through
        a novel hierarchical task management architecture. The system&#39;s foundation
        is built on our Hierarchical Task DAG (HTDAG) framework, which dynamically
        decomposes high-level objectives into manageable sub-tasks while rigorously
        maintaining dependencies and execution coherence. Deep Agent advances beyond
        traditional agent systems through three key innovations: First, it implements
        a recursive two-stage planner-executor architecture that enables continuous
        task refinement and adaptation as circumstances change. Second, it features
        an Autonomous API &amp; Tool Creation (AATC) system that automatically generates
        reusable components from UI interactions, substantially reducing operational
        costs for similar tasks. Third, it incorporates Prompt Tweaking Engine and
        Autonomous Prompt Feedback Learning components that optimize Large Language
        Model prompts for specific scenarios, enhancing both inference accuracy and
        operational stability. These components are integrated to form a service infrastructure
        that manages user contexts, handles complex task dependencies, and orchestrates
        end-to-end agentic workflow execution. Through this sophisticated architecture,
        Deep Agent establishes a novel paradigm in self-governing AI systems, demonstrating
        robust capability to independently handle intricate, multi-step tasks while
        maintaining consistent efficiency and reliability through continuous self-optimization.

      barely surfaced from a landslide of NFT and crypto hype that characterized the
      early 2020s, and the metaverse bubble that followed, before media voices began
      singing the praises of[generative AI] (gen AI) in the wake of releases such
      as OpenAI\u2019s[GPT] model family, Anthropic\u2019s[Claude] and Microsoft\u2019s
      Copilot.\\nWhile the chorus hasn\u2019t moved on entirely, the focus in 2025
      has shifted from[large language models (LLMs)] to advancements in the ostensibly
      autonomous[artificial intelligence (AI)] agents ushering in the future of work.\\nDespite
      a momentary surge in gen AI interest around[Deepseek] \u2019s R1, which promised
      significant performance improvements over ChatGPT, the dominant innovation narrative
      in 2025 is the AI agent.\\nMedia coverage highlights the promises of innovation,[automation]
      and efficiency agents will bring, but how much of the conversation is click-hungry
      hype?\\nThe ad-supported media world thrives on clicks, and it\u2019s reasonable
      to expect sensational, attention-grabbing headlines crafted to garner yours.
      But what can we realistically expect from[agentic AI] in 2025, and how will
      it affect our lives?\\nWe spoke with several IBM experts to cut through the
      hype, with the goal of holding a more reasonable conversation about AI agents
      and what they\u2019re going to do. Our team of informed insiders includes:\\n*

      What are AI agents?\\nAn AI agent is a software program capable of acting autonomously
      to understand, plan and execute tasks. AI agents are powered by LLMs and can
      interface with tools, other models and other aspects of a system or network
      as needed to fulfill user goals.\\nWe\u2019re going beyond asking a chatbot
      to suggest a dinner recipe based on the available ingredients in the fridge.
      Agents are more than automated[customer experience] emails that inform you it\u2019ll
      be a few days until a real-world human can get to your inquiry.\\n[AI agents
      differ from traditional AI assistants] that need a prompt each time they generate
      a response. In theory, a user gives an agent a high-level task, and the agent
      figures out how to complete it.\\nCurrent offerings are still in the early stages
      of approaching this idea. \u201CWhat\u2019s commonly referred to as \u2018agents\u2019
      in the market is the addition of rudimentary planning and tool-calling (sometimes
      called function calling) capabilities to LLMs,\u201D says Ashoori. \u201CThese
      enable the LLM to break down complex tasks into smaller steps that the LLM can
      perform.\u201D\\nHay is optimistic that more robust agents are on the way: \u201CYou
      wouldn\u2019t need any further progression in models today to build[future AI
      agents],\u201D he says.\\nWith that out of the way, what\u2019s the conversation
      about agents over the coming year, and how much of it can we take seriously?\\nAI
      agents\\n### What are AI agents?\\nFrom monolithic models to compound AI systems,
      discover how AI agents integrate with databases and external tools to enhance
      problem-solving capabilities and adaptability.\\n[\\nLearn more\\n] \\n## Narrative
      1: 2025 is the year of the AI agent\\n\u201CMore and better agents\u201D are
      on the way, predicts Time.[1] \u201CAutonomous \u2018agents\u2019 and profitability
      are likely to dominate the artificial intelligence agenda,\u201D reports Reuters.[2]
      \u201CThe age of agentic AI has arrived,\u201D promises Forbes, in response
      to a claim from Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang.[3] \\nTech media is awash with assurances
      that our lives are on the verge of a total transformation. Autonomous agents
      are poised to streamline and alter our jobs, drive optimization and accompany
      us in our daily lives, handling our mundanities in real time and freeing us
      up for creative pursuits and other higher-level tasks.\\n### 2025 as the year
      of agentic exploration\\n\u201CIBM and Morning Consult did a survey of 1,000
      developers who are building AI applications for enterprise, and 99% of them
      said they are exploring or developing AI agents,\u201D\_explains Ashoori. \u201CSo
      yes, the answer is that 2025 is going to be the year of the agent.\u201D However,
      that declaration is not without nuance.\\nAfter establishing the current market
      conception of agents as LLMs with function calling, Ashoori draws a distinction
      between that idea and truly autonomous agents. \u201CThe true definition [of
      an AI agent] is an intelligent entity with reasoning and planning capabilities
      that can autonomously take action. Those reasoning and planning capabilities
      are up for discussion. It depends on how you define that.\u201D\\n\u201CI definitely
      see AI agents heading in this direction, but we\u2019re not fully there yet,\u201D
      says Gajjar. \u201CRight now, we\u2019re seeing early glimpses\u2014AI agents
      can already analyze data, predict trends and automate workflows to some extent.
      But building AI agents that can autonomously handle complex decision-making
      will take more than just better algorithms. We\u2019ll need big leaps in contextual
      reasoning and testing for edge cases,\u201D she adds.\\nDanilevsky isn\u2019t
      convinced that this is anything new. \u201CI&#39;m still struggling to truly
      believe that this is all that different from just orchestration,\u201D she says.
      \u201CYou&#39;ve renamed orchestration, but now it&#39;s called agents, because
      that&#39;s the cool word. But orchestration is something that we&#39;ve been
      doing in programming forever.\u201D\\nWith regard to 2025 being the year of
      the agent, Danilevsky is skeptical. \u201CIt depends on what you say an agent
      is, what you think an agent is going to accomplish and what kind of value you
      think it will bring,\u201D she says. \u201CIt&#39;s quite a statement to make
      when we haven&#39;t even yet figured out ROI (return on investment) on LLM technology
      more generally.\u201D\\nAnd it\u2019s not just the business side that has her
      hedging her bets. \u201CThere&#39;s the hype of imagining if this thing could
      think for you and make all these decisions and take actions on your computer.
      Realistically, that&#39;s terrifying.\u201D\\nDanilevsky frames the disconnect
      as one of miscommunication. \u201C[Agents] tend to be very ineffective because
      humans are very bad communicators. We still can&#39;t get chat agents to interpret
      what you want correctly all the time.\u201D\\nStill, the forthcoming year holds
      a lot of promise as an era of experimentation. \u201CI&#39;m a big believer
      in [2025 as the year of the agent],\u201D says Hay excitedly.\\nEvery large
      tech company and hundreds of startups are now experimenting with agents. Salesforce,
      for example, has released their Agentforce platform, which enables users to
      create agents that are easily integrated within the Salesforce app ecosystem.\\n\u201CThe
      wave is coming and we&#39;re going to have a lot of agents. It&#39;s still a
      very nascent ecosystem, so I think a lot of people are going to build agents,
      and they&#39;re going to have a lot of fun.\u201D\\n## Narrative 2: Agents can
      handle highly complex tasks on their own\\nThis narrative assumes that today\u2019s
      agents meet the theoretical definition outlined in the introduction to this
      piece. 2025\u2019s agents will be fully autonomous AI programs that can scope
      out a project and complete it with all the necessary tools they need and with
      no help from human partners. But what\u2019s missing from this narrative is
      nuance.\\n### Today\u2019s models are more than enough\\nHay believes that the
      groundwork has already been laid for such developments. \u201CThe big thing
      about agents is that they have the ability to plan,\u201D he outlines. \u201CThey
      have the ability to reason, to use tools and perform tasks, and they need to
      do it at speed and scale.\u201D\\nHe cites 4 developments that, compared to
      the best models of 12 to 18 months ago, mean that the models of early 2025 can
      power the agents envisioned by the proponents of this narrative:\\n* Better,
      faster, smaller models\\n* Chain-of-thought (COT) training\\n* Increased context
      windows\\n* Function calling\\n\u201CNow, most of these things are in play,\u201D
      Hay continues. \u201CYou can have the AI call tools. It can plan. It can reason
      and come back with good answers. It can use inference-time compute. You\u2019ll
      have better chains of thought and more memory to work with. It&#39;s going to
      run fast. It\u2019s going to be cheap. That leads you to a structure where I
      think you can have agents. The models are improving and they&#39;re getting
      better, so that&#39;s only going to accelerate.\u201D\\n### Realistic expectations
      are a must\\nAshoori is careful to differentiate between what agents will be
      able to do later, and what they can do now. \u201CThere is the promise, and
      there is what the agent&#39;s capable of doing today,\u201D she says. \u201CI
      would say the answer depends on the use case. For simple use cases, the agents
      are capable of [choosing the correct tool], but for more sophisticated use cases,

      reshaping the future of work, decision-making, and enterprise strategy.\\n###
      Author\\n##### **\\nAlexander Zagnetko\\n***Manager,*Process Organization and
      Improvement\\n[Contact us for more information] \\n#### From Generative to Agentic
      AI\\nOver the past five years, we\u2019ve witnessed a dramatic leap in AI capabilities.
      From the launch of GPT-3 in 2020 to the widespread adoption of models like GPT-4,
      Claude, and Gemini between 2023 and 2024, generative AI has already revolutionized
      numerous industries. But as impressive as these developments are, they represent
      just the beginning of a much broader transformation.\\nThe next major milestone
      is the rise of autonomous agents\u2014systems that can now carry out complex
      workflows and collaborate with humans or other agents. These systems set their
      own goals, plan their actions, use tools, and adapt to changing conditions.
      Unlike traditional AI agents designed for narrow, specific tasks, agentic AI
      systems operate with much greater independence. They are built to:\\n* Perceive
      their environment through both structured and unstructured data,\\n* Plan actions
      using logic and decision-making frameworks,\\n* Execute tasks using tools, APIs,
      or physical devices,\\n* Learn from feedback and improve over time,\\n* Collaborate
      with humans and other agents.\\nThe shift from generative to agentic AI marks
      a fundamental leap in artificial intelligence. It stems from the integration
      of multiple capabilities: large language models (LLMs), memory systems, planning
      algorithms, tool integration, and multi-agent coordination. Together, these
      elements enable AI systems to function as digital workers\u2014capable of performing
      tasks that once required human judgment and coordination. Agentic AI is opening
      up entirely new possibilities and will have a profound impact on business strategy,
      organizational design, and competitive advantage.\\n#### Technical Foundations
      of Agentic AI\\nAgAI systems are built on a layered architecture that combines
      several advanced technologies. Let\u2019s break down the core components. At
      the heart of most agentic systems is a**large language model (LLM)**such as
      GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini. These models are trained on massive datasets and can
      understand and generate human-like language. They provide the linguistic and
      reasoning capabilities that underpin agent behaviour. Unlike traditional chatbots,
      agentic systems need to**remember past interactions**, decisions, and outcomes.
      Memory enables agents to learn from experience, personalize interactions, and
      maintain continuity over time.\\nFor agents to act autonomously, they must be
      able to plan several steps ahead and consider the consequences of their decisions.
      This is why they combine reasoning with tool use\u2014a method known as ReAct
      (Reasoning &#43; Acting)\u2014and explore multiple logical pathways before choosing
      a course of action, a technique referred to as Tree-of-Thoughts. Another well-known
      approach to evaluating potential actions is Monte Carlo Tree Search, originally
      developed for game-playing AI. These techniques enable agents to break down
      complex goals into manageable tasks and respond flexibly to feedback.\\nAs agents
      become more autonomous, ensuring their responsible and ethical behavior becomes
      increasingly important. This is essential for building trust and deploying agentic
      AI in a safe and accountable way. Key mechanisms include:\\n* **Human-in-the-loop**\u2013
      giving humans the ability to approve or override an agent\u2019s decisions.\\n*
      **Audit trails**\u2013 tracking the agent\u2019s actions to ensure accountability.\\n*
      **Ethical constraints**\u2013 rules that prevent harmful or unethical behavior.\\n*
      **Value alignment**\u2013 ensuring agents act in accordance with human values.\\n####
      AI Agents as the New Digital Workforce\\nAgentic AI is opening up new possibilities
      for businesses in terms of efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Whether
      it\u2019s automating routine tasks or orchestrating complex workflows, agentic
      AI is finding broad applications across sectors\u2014from financial services
      and healthcare to education, retail, and software development.\\naccount\\\\_balance\\\\_wallet##
      Financial Services\\nThe financial sector has long been a frontrunner in AI
      adoption, and agentic AI takes automation to the next level. Autonomous agents
      can monitor market conditions in real time, assess risks, and execute trades
      with minimal human oversight. They continuously scan transactions for suspicious
      activity, track regulatory updates, and ensure compliance. In customer service
      and advisory roles, agents analyze client data and recommend tailored financial
      products, effectively acting as digital financial advisors.\\nmedical\\\\_services##
      Healthcare\\nHealthcare is one of the most complex and data-intensive sectors,
      making it a natural fit for agentic AI. Agents can analyze medical records,
      test results, and imaging data, flag potential drug interactions, suggest additional
      diagnostics, and assist with documentation. They also coordinate care by scheduling
      appointments, managing referrals, and reducing redundancies. On the administrative
      side, agents streamline tasks like billing, claims processing, and regulatory
      compliance, allowing medical professionals to focus more on patient care.\\ngavel##
      Legal and Compliance\\nThe legal sector is undergoing a major transformation
      thanks to agentic AI. Autonomous agents can read, interpret, and generate legal
      documents, analyze contracts, highlight key clauses, flag risks, suggest edits,
      and draft standard agreements based on templates and client requirements. They
      also monitor regulatory changes across jurisdictions, evaluate their impact,
      and recommend compliance actions. In litigation, they assist with legal research,
      summarizing precedents, and preparing arguments.\\ncast\\\\_for\\\\_education##
      Education and Training\\nDigital transformation has reached education as well.
      AI agents serve as interactive tutors, answering questions in real time, providing
      feedback, and adapting to individual learning styles. They can even detect emotional
      cues to offer support when motivation is low. In assessments, agents automatically
      grade assignments, generate tests, and provide detailed feedback, while identifying
      performance trends and recommending timely interventions.\\nstorefront## Retail
      and E-commerce\\nIn the retail sector, companies use agentic AI to enhance customer
      experience, optimize operations, and boost sales. In logistics, agents forecast
      demand, manage inventory, coordinate with suppliers, and respond to market changes
      in real time\u2014for example, by rerouting deliveries or adjusting pricing.
      In marketing, they design targeted campaigns, segment audiences, and optimize
      content, improving product placement and promotional strategies based on customer
      behavior.\\nwebhook## Software Development\\nAgentic AI is also revolutionizing
      the entire software development lifecycle\u2014from design to deployment. Agents
      can generate code from natural language, detect and fix bugs, optimize performance,
      and create documentation and tests. In product management, they gather user
      feedback, prioritize features, draft specifications, and coordinate team collaboration,
      accelerating innovation and improving product quality.\\n#### Speed of Implementation
      Is the Competitive Advantage\\nAgentic AI is not just about boosting efficiency\u2014it\u2019s
      a fundamental shift in how companies operate, make decisions, and create value.
      By combining large language models, memory systems, planning algorithms, and
      the ability to interact with external tools, agentic AI becomes an active participant
      in business processes. Its impact goes beyond any single department\u2014it\u2019s
      transforming entire industries, from finance and healthcare to software development.\\nOrganizations
      that understand and implement this technology early will gain a competitive
      edge\u2014not only through speed and precision but also through their ability
      to respond to market changes, personalize services, and innovate faster than
      ever before.\\n## Contact our experts\\nShould you wish more information on

      where they detail the shifting relationship between humans and AI Agents\u2026\\nThis
      is why I found this recent study interesting (*the image below*) where they
      extended the levels from what was typically**5 levels**, to**6 levels**.\\nThe
      one extreme is Level 0, here the human dominates and AI plays no role. And on
      the other extreme, Level 5, where the human has no role and the AI takes full
      control.\\nAnd in between are these steps of going from one level to another.\\n>

      [WhatsApp] [Messenger] [LinkedIn] [X (Twitter)] \\nPrint article\\nIn artificial
      intelligence, 2025 marked a decisive shift. Systems once confined to research
      labs and prototypes began to appear as everyday tools. At the center of this
      transition was the rise of AI agents \u2013AI systems that can use other software
      tools and act on their own.\\nWhile researchers have studied AI for more than
      60 years, and the term \u201Cagent\u201D has long been part of the field\u2019s
      vocabulary, 2025 was the year the concept became concrete for developers and
      consumers alike.\\nAI agents moved from theory to infrastructure, reshaping
      how people interact with large language models, the systems that power chatbots
      like ChatGPT.\\nIn 2025, the definition of AI agent shifted from the[academic
      framing] of systems that perceive, reason and act to AI company[Anthropic\u2019s
      description] of large language models that are capable of using software tools
      and taking autonomous action. While large language models have long excelled
      at text-based responses, the recent change is their expanding capacity to act,
      using tools, calling[APIs], coordinating with other systems and completing tasks
      independently.\\nThis shift did not happen overnight. A key inflection point
      came in late 2024, when Anthropic released the[Model Context Protocol]. The
      protocol allowed developers to connect large language models to external tools
      in a standardized way, effectively giving models the ability to act beyond generating
      text. With that, the stage was set for 2025 to become the year of AI agents.\\n[![Embedded
      YouTube video]] \\nAI agents are a whole new ballgame compared with generative
      AI.## The milestones that defined 2025\\nThe momentum accelerated quickly. In
      January, the release of Chinese model[DeepSeek-R1] as an[open-weight] model
      disrupted assumptions about who could build high-performing large language models,
      briefly rattling markets and intensifying global competition. An open-weight
      model is an AI model whose training, reflected in values called weights, is
      publicly available. Throughout 2025, major U.S. labs such as[OpenAI],[Anthropic],[Google]
      and[xAI] released larger, high-performance models, while Chinese tech companies
      including[Alibaba],[Tencent], and[DeepSeek] expanded the open-model ecosystem
      to the point where the Chinese models have been[downloaded more than American
      models].\\n##### Another turning point came in April, when Google introduced
      its[Agent2Agent protocol]. While Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol focused
      on how agents use tools, Agent2Agent addressed how agents communicate with each
      other. Crucially, the two protocols were designed to work together. Later in
      the year, both[Anthropic] and[Google] donated their protocols to the open-source
      software nonprofit Linux Foundation, cementing them as open standards rather
      than proprietary experiments.\\nThese developments quickly found their way into
      consumer products. By mid-2025, \u201Cagentic browsers\u201D began to appear.
      Tools such as[Perplexity\u2019s Comet],[Browser Company\u2019s Dia],[OpenAI\u2019s
      GPT Atlas],[Copilot in Microsoft\u2019s Edge],[ASI X Inc.\u2019s Fellou],[MainFunc.ai\u2019s
      Genspark],[Opera\u2019s Opera Neon] and others reframed the browser as an active
      participant rather than a passive interface. For example, rather than helping
      you search for vacation details, it plays a part in booking the vacation.\\nAt
      the same time, workflow builders like[n8n] and[Google\u2019s Antigravity] lowered
      the technical barrier for creating custom agent systems beyond what has already
      happened with coding agents like[Cursor] and[GitHub Copilot].\\n## New power,
      new risks\\nAs agents became more capable, their risks became harder to ignore.
      In November, Anthropic disclosed how its Claude Code agent[had been misused]
      to automate parts of a cyberattack. The incident illustrated a broader concern:
      By automating repetitive, technical work, AI agents can also lower the barrier
      for malicious activity.\\nThis tension defined much of 2025. AI agents expanded
      what individuals and organizations could do, but they also[amplified existing
      vulnerabilities]. Systems that were once isolated text generators became interconnected,
      tool-using actors operating with little human oversight.\\n[![Embedded YouTube
      video]] \\nThe business community is gearing up for multiagent systems.## What
      to watch for in 2026\\nLooking ahead, several open questions are likely to shape
      the next phase of AI agents.\\nOne is benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks, which
      are like a structured exam with a series of questions and standardized scoring,
      work well for single models, but[agents are composite systems] made up of models,
      tools, memory and decision logic. Researchers increasingly want to evaluate[not
      just outcomes, but processes]. This would be like asking students to show their
      work, not just provide an answer.\\nProgress here will be critical for improving
      reliability and trust, and ensuring that an AI agent will perform the task at
      hand. One method is establishing clear definitions around[AI agents and AI workflows].
      Organizations will need to map out exactly where AI will[integrate into workflows
      or introduce new ones].\\nAnother development to watch is governance. In late
      2025, the Linux Foundation announced the creation of the[Agentic AI Foundation],
      signaling an effort to establish shared standards and best practices. If successful,
      it could play a role like the[World Wide Web Consortium] in shaping an open,
      interoperable agent ecosystem.\\nThere is also a growing debate over model size.
      While large, general-purpose models dominate headlines, smaller and more specialized
      models are often[better suited to specific tasks]. As agents become configurable
      consumer and business tools, whether through browsers or workflow management
      software, the power to choose the right model increasingly shifts to users rather
      than labs or corporations.\\n## The challenges ahead\\nDespite the optimism,
      significant socio-technical challenges remain. Expanding data center infrastructure[strains
      energy grids] and affects local communities. In workplaces, agents raise concerns
      about automation,[job displacement] and surveillance.\\nFrom a security perspective,
      connecting models to tools and stacking agents together[multiplies risks] that
      are already unresolved in standalone large language models. Specifically, AI
      practitioners are addressing the dangers of[indirect prompt injections], where
      prompts are hidden in open web spaces that are readable by AI agents and result
      in harmful or unintended actions.\\nRegulation is another unresolved issue.
      Compared with[Europe] and[China], the United States has relatively limited oversight
      of algorithmic systems. As AI agents become embedded across digital life, questions
      about access, accountability and limits remain largely unanswered.\\nMeeting
      these challenges will require more than technical breakthroughs. It demands[rigorous
      engineering practices], careful design and clear documentation of how systems
      work and fail. Only by treating AI agents as socio-technical systems rather
      than mere software components, I believe, can we build an AI ecosystem that
      is both innovative and safe.\\n**\\n* [Artificial intelligence (AI)] \\n* [Google]

      \\n#### Introduction\\nSoftware development is entering a new era where artificial
      intelligence doesn\u2019t just assist developers, but actively builds, tests,
      and improves applications on its own.\\nIn 2025, this evolution is being led
      by a new class of intelligent systems known as Agentic AI &#8211; autonomous
      AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and taking actions independently.
      Unlike traditional AI tools that require constant human input, Agentic AI can
      analyze goals, make decisions, and execute tasks end-to-end transforming how
      businesses create and manage software.\\nFor years, companies have struggled
      with familiar challenges:\\n* Slow development cycles that delay releases.\\n*
      Rising engineering costs with limited resources.\\n* Complex integrations across
      legacy systems.\\n* Dependency on manual processes that limit scalability.\\nAgentic
      AI changes this dynamic. These intelligent agents can automate entire parts
      of the development lifecycle from writing and reviewing code to running tests
      and deploying updates, freeing teams to focus on innovation rather than repetitive
      work.\\nAs a result, organizations adopting Agentic AI aren\u2019t just accelerating
      development speed; they\u2019re reimagining what software teams can achieve
      with autonomous systems that think, act, and learn continuously.\\nIn this blog,
      we\u2019ll explore how Agentic AI is transforming software development in 2025,
      the real-world impact it\u2019s already making, and how businesses can strategically
      implement it to gain a long-term competitive edge.\\n#### What Is Agentic AI
      and How Does It Work?\\nBefore diving into how Agentic AI is transforming software
      development, it\u2019s important to understand what it actually is and why it\u2019s
      considered the next major leap in[artificial intelligence].\\nAgentic AI refers
      to a new generation of autonomous AI systems that can perceive information,
      reason through objectives, and take actions independently all without requiring
      continuous human instructions. Unlike traditional AI tools that respond to commands
      or prompts, Agentic AI Agents operate based on goals. They can interpret context,
      plan tasks, make decisions, and execute actions on their own much like how a
      skilled developer might handle an assignment from start to finish.\\n##### How
      Agentic AI Works\\nAgentic AI works through a continuous cognitive loop that
      mirrors human-like thinking. Each agent follows a process of perception, reasoning,
      action, and reflection, enabling it to learn and improve over time.\\nHere\u2019s
      how this plays out in practice:\\n* **Perception:**The AI Agent gathers context
      such as project requirements, past code commits, or bug reports from connected
      systems.\\n* **Reasoning:**It analyzes this information using its internal logic,
      memory, and large language models to determine the best next steps.\\n* **Action:**The
      agent performs the required tasks like generating code, testing modules, or
      deploying builds through integrated tools or APIs.\\n* **Reflection:**It evaluates
      the outcome, identifies what worked or failed, and refines its next decisions
      accordingly.\\n##### How Agentic AI Differs from Traditional AI\\nTraditional
      AI models are reactive, they provide answers when prompted. In contrast, Agentic
      AI is proactive. It acts on defined goals, manages tasks across multiple systems,
      and even collaborates with other AI agents to complete larger objectives.\\nFor
      instance, while a conventional AI coding assistant can help generate snippets
      of code, an Agentic AI system can oversee the entire process from analyzing
      requirements to writing, testing, and deploying code autonomously.\\nThis shift
      marks the beginning of AI-driven software ecosystems where intelligent agents
      work alongside human teams to optimize speed, quality, and scalability.\\nTo
      understand**what Agentic AI is, how it functions, and the complete lifecycle
      of an AI agent**, read our detailed guide here:[**What Is Agentic AI? A Complete
      Guide to Its Lifecycle and Functions**].\\n#### How Autonomous AI Agents Are
      Transforming Software Development in 2025\\nSoftware development has always
      been about collaboration of designers, developers, testers, and project managers
      working together to bring an idea to life. But in 2025, a new kind of collaborator
      has joined the team:**Autonomous AI Agents**.\\nThese intelligent, self-operating
      AI systems go beyond simple automation. They understand objectives, make independent
      decisions, and execute end-to-end workflows within the[software development
      lifecycle] (SDLC) transforming how modern teams plan, build, test, and deploy
      software.\\nLet\u2019s explore how Agentic AI is reshaping every stage of development:\\n1.
      **Planning and Requirement Analysis**\\nIn traditional software planning, teams
      spend extensive time gathering requirements, analyzing dependencies, and setting
      milestones. Agentic AI accelerates this process through intelligent automation.\\nAI
      Agents can read documentation, project briefs, and performance data to extract
      accurate requirements automatically. They detect dependencies, forecast development
      timelines, and assess risks using real-time data insights.\\nBy leveraging AI-driven
      project analysis, businesses gain faster planning cycles, better decision-making,
      and improved resource utilization &#8211; all key to delivering successful,
      high-quality products.\\n2. **Code Generation and Review**\\nThe coding stage
      is where autonomous AI Agents truly revolutionize AI software development. Unlike
      basic AI coding assistants, these agents can generate entire modules, optimize
      logic, and ensure adherence to industry standards.\\nThey interpret requirements,
      create efficient algorithms, and perform automated code reviews to identify
      syntax errors, security gaps, or performance bottlenecks. This not only enhances
      code quality but also reduces development time and human dependency.\\nBy integrating
      AI-powered code generation and validation, development teams achieve faster
      release cycles, improved maintainability, and greater consistency across projects.\\n3.
      **Testing and Quality Assurance**\\nAI in software testing has evolved dramatically
      with the rise of Agentic AI. Instead of relying on manual QA teams, AI Agents
      autonomously execute testing workflows from creating test cases to identifying
      and fixing bugs.\\nThese agents continuously learn from past results, improving
      their accuracy and predicting potential failures before they occur. They validate
      builds, monitor regression, and ensure that every release meets high performance
      and reliability standards.\\nThe outcome: shorter testing cycles, higher accuracy,
      and more stable software deployments.\\n4. **Deployment and CI/CD Automation**\\nDeployment
      is one of the most complex and time-sensitive stages of software delivery. Autonomous
      AI agents simplify this through end-to-end[CI/CD automation.] \\nThey integrate
      seamlessly with DevOps pipelines, handling build management, environment setup,
      and deployment tasks with precision. During live deployments, AI Agents monitor
      performance, detect anomalies, and automatically roll back faulty builds ensuring
      zero downtime and continuous delivery stability.\\nThis creates a self-managing
      DevOps ecosystem that enhances release reliability and operational efficiency.\\n5.
      **Continuous Improvement and Maintenance**\\nWith Agentic AI, software maintenance
      transforms from a reactive task into a proactive, self-optimizing process.\\nAI
      agents constantly monitor application performance, analyze user behavior, and
      identify inefficiencies in real time. They recommend performance optimizations,
      manage dependency updates, and even handle minor issue resolutions autonomously.\\nThis
      continuous learning loop ensures that your systems evolve intelligently improving
      scalability, stability, and efficiency over time without manual intervention.\\nBy
      adopting Agentic AI solutions, organizations move beyond static automation into
      a new era of AI-driven software development where every stage of the lifecycle
      is optimized, intelligent, and self-improving.\\n[SculptSoft], a trusted custom

      autonomous AI agents represents a transformative leap in the evolution of artificial
      intelligence. These intelligent systems, capable of independently perceiving
      environments, making decisions, learning from experience, and executing multi-step
      actions without continuous human oversight, are redefining the boundaries of
      what machines can accomplish. Unlike traditional rule-based or supervised AI
      systems, autonomous agents integrate deep learning, reinforcement learning,
      natural language processing, and multi-modal decision frameworks to solve complex,
      dynamic, and often ambiguous real-world problems. This paper explores the technological
      underpinnings, capabilities, applications, and implications of autonomous AI
      agents. It critically examines their deployment in sectors such as healthcare,
      finance, cybersecurity, logistics, manufacturing, education, and scientific
      research. Furthermore, it addresses the ethical, legal, and socio-technical

      Intelligence] \\n## **Executive Summary**\\nThe first quarter of 2025 marked
      a period of intense activity and significant evolution in the field of Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) agents.\\n* Characterized by a**rapid transition from research
      concepts to tangible products**, this timeframe solidified the notion of 2025
      as a pivotal \\\"year of the agent,\\\" albeit one accompanied by considerable
      hype and persistent challenges. (1)\\n* The definition of**AI agents increasingly
      centered on systems, typically built upon Large Language Models (LLMs)**, capable
      of autonomous task execution through planning, reasoning, and the crucial ability
      to utilize external tools. (4)\\n* **Major technology companies, including OpenAI,
      Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, and Meta, accelerated the push towards commercialization**,
      unveiling a suite of new agent platforms, specialized agents targeting specific
      workflows (e.g., software development, sales, security, research), and underlying
      infrastructure components. (7)\\n* **Research simultaneously advanced**, focusing
      on enhancing core capabilities like reasoning, fostering human-AI collaboration,
      and developing multi-agent systems (MAS) capable of complex interactions. (12)\\n*
      Concurrently,**the discourse surrounding the challenges, limitations, and ethical
      implications intensified**. Concerns regarding reliability, safety, control,
      bias, and privacy became more prominent as agent autonomy increased, prompting
      calls for robust governance frameworks and dedicated agent infrastructure. (16)\\n*
      While the potential for AI agents to automate tasks and augment human capabilities
      is increasingly evident,**significant hurdles in achieving dependable, safe,
      and ethically aligned performance remained a primary focus**for the industry
      moving forward. (20)\\n## **Defining the AI Agent Landscape (Early 2025)**\\n###
      **Conceptual Evolution and Definitions**\\nThe understanding and definition
      of AI agents underwent a notable transformation leading into early 2025, largely
      catalyzed by advancements in LLMs. Historically, the concept of an agent was
      rooted in computer science and cognitive science, often defined broadly as anything
      capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon it through
      actuators. Early work emphasized properties like autonomy, social ability, reactivity,
      and proactivity. (4)\\nHowever, by the first quarter of 2025, the prevailing
      conceptualization became intrinsically linked to the capabilities offered by
      modern LLMs. (4)\\nWhile no single, universally accepted definition existed
      (24), a strong consensus emerged viewing AI agents as systems or programs capable
      of*autonomously performing tasks*on behalf of a user or another system. This
      autonomy involved designing their own workflows and utilizing available tools
      to achieve specified goals. (1)\\nThis modern understanding clearly differentiated
      AI agents from simpler AI applications like chatbots or traditional automation.
      Unlike chatbots primarily focused on conversational responses based on pre-existing
      data (6), or traditional systems executing predefined algorithms within constraints
      (4), early 2025 agents were characterized by their ability to plan, reason,
      learn, and interact dynamically with their environment to accomplish complex,
      often multi-step objectives. (4) They leveraged LLMs as core reasoning or processing
      components but augmented them with essential capabilities like memory, planning
      modules, and mechanisms for tool use. (4) This augmentation was crucial, addressing
      inherent LLM limitations such as statelessness (lack of memory between interactions)
      and the inability to directly interact with or affect the external world. (17)
      The term \\\"agentic AI\\\" also gained traction, often referring to systems
      composed of multiple, potentially collaborative, AI agents working towards a
      common objective. (28)\\nThe evolution of the definition directly mirrors the
      enabling power of LLMs. While the theoretical foundations of agency existed
      for decades (4), the practical ability of LLMs to understand complex instructions,
      reason about tasks, and generate plausible action steps provided the foundation
      for building agents that could move beyond theoretical constructs and execute
      tasks in the real world (primarily digital environments). The focus shifted
      from defining agency based on abstract properties to defining it based on the
      functional capabilities enabled by integrating LLMs with planning, memory, and
      tool-using mechanisms. This practical turn, driven by LLM advancements, underpins
      the surge in agent development and deployment observed in early 2025.\\n###
      **Core Capabilities**\\nThe AI agents emerging in early 2025 were defined by
      a set of core capabilities that enabled their autonomous and goal-directed behavior.
      These capabilities, often working in concert and built upon LLM foundations,
      distinguished them from prior AI systems:\\n* **Autonomy:**This was perhaps
      the most central characteristic. Agents were expected to operate with minimal
      human intervention or continuous oversight, capable of initiating and completing
      tasks independently.1 The degree of autonomy existed on a spectrum. Some systems
      were semi-autonomous, requiring human oversight for critical decisions (26),
      while others aimed for, or raised concerns about, higher levels of autonomy,
      potentially even \\\"fully autonomous\\\" operation where agents could act without
      predefined constraints, a prospect met with significant safety concerns. (18)\\n*
      **Learning &amp; Adaptation:**Agents were designed to improve their performance
      over time. This involved learning from environmental feedback, past interactions,
      and accumulated experience.3 Mechanisms like reinforcement learning allowed
      agents to refine strategies based on outcomes. (26) The ability to self-evaluate
      and correct errors was also highlighted. (32) Memory, both short-term (for maintaining
      context within a task) and long-term (for retaining historical data and preferences),
      was crucial for adaptation and personalization. (26)\\n* **Reasoning &amp; Decision-Making:**Agents
      needed to process perceived information, analyze data, make judgments, and select
      appropriate actions to achieve their goals. (1) LLMs often served as the core
      \\\"reasoning engine\\\" (32), interpreting inputs and generating potential
      action plans. The period saw the emergence of specialized models explicitly
      optimized for reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance agent decision-making capabilities.
      (12)\\n* **Interaction:**Agents were defined by their ability to engage with
      their environment. This involved perception \u2013gathering information through
      various inputs like text, voice, images, sensors, data feeds, or APIs (1) \u2013and
      action \u2013influencing the environment through outputs like generating text,
      sending commands to software, executing code, or making API calls. (1) Crucially,
      this interaction extended beyond simple user dialogue to include engagement
      with external systems, tools, data sources, and potentially other agents or
      humans. (1)\\n* **Planning &amp; Goal-Directedness:**Agents were designed to
      be proactive and goal-oriented. (24) This required the ability to understand
      a high-level objective, decompose it into smaller, manageable steps (task decomposition),
      formulate a sequence of actions (planning), and then execute that plan. (5)
      The capability for long-term planning, reasoning about extended sequences of
      actions, was also an area of development and concern. (12)\\n* **Tool Usage:**A
      key enabler of agent functionality was the ability to utilize external tools.
      These could include APIs for accessing external services (like weather data,
      booking systems, or databases), web search capabilities, code interpreters,
      calculators, or even invoking other AI models or agents. (4) Tool use allowed
      agents to overcome the inherent limitations of their base LLMs (e.g., accessing
      real-time information, performing precise calculations, interacting with specific
      software) and act effectively in the environment. (6)\\nThe confluence of these
      capabilities defined the ambition for AI agents in early 2025. The objective
      was clear: to transition AI from being passive responders or pattern recognizers
      to becoming active, autonomous participants capable of understanding goals,
      formulating plans, interacting with the digital world through tools, learning
      from outcomes, and ultimately achieving complex objectives with reduced human
      guidance. This represented a significant functional leap, enabling the automation
      of tasks previously requiring human cognition and intervention.\\n### **C. Agent
      Architectures and Components**\\nThe design of AI agents in early 2025 commonly
      followed specific architectural patterns, reflecting attempts to harness the
      power of LLMs while mitigating their weaknesses. Agents were frequently described
      as*compound systems*. (24) This meant they were not monolithic entities but
      rather architectures built around a foundation model (typically an LLM) augmented
      by external resources or modules, often referred to as \\\"scaffolding\\\".
      (5) This scaffolding provided capabilities the base LLM lacked, such as persistent
      memory, structured planning, and interfaces for tool\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle:

      POINTS\\n* **Agentic AI is revolutionizing construction by enabling autonomous
      systems to plan, monitor, and update tasks, offering multi-step reasoning and
      decision-making beyond traditional AI workflows and Large Language Models (LLMs).**\\n*
      **Tools simplify software development by generating, modifying, and testing
      code from written requirements, reducing manual coding time and empowering non-coders
      to create apps and automations.**\\n* **While agentic AI accelerates innovation,
      one expert suggested that users must maintain a \u201Chuman in the loop.\u201D**\\nWhat
      a difference a year makes in the world of[construction tech].\\nDelegates attending
      day two of the recent Buildings Show in Toronto heard how agentic AI is rapidly
      emerging as construction\u2019s third wave of[AI], moving beyond Large Language
      Models (LLMs) and[automated workflows] to create a world of autonomous systems
      that plan, monitor, and update[project tasks], as well aswrite code.\\nDigital
      innovation specialist Mahir Dheendsa of[Amrize] (formerly Lafarge), host of
      a session titled \u201CAI Agents and the Robotic Workforce: Reimagining the
      Future of Construction,\u201Dsaid the use of agentic AI is accelerating. So
      rapidly that the preview of the session he wrote for the show program months
      ago was already out of date.\\n![DW-buildings-show-AI-agencyweb] \\nDigital
      innovation specialist Mahir Dheendsa of Amrize spoke about AI agents at the
      Buildings Show in Toronto, Dec. 4. Dheendsa took a moment to outline how Amrize
      represents the new brand for Lafarge. Image: Don Wall\\n\u201CAgentic AI has
      been the talk of the town and the major headline in the AI space this year,\u201D
      said Dheendsa. \u201CWe haven\u2019t really seen any major advancements in robotics,
      so I\u2019m willing to sort of skip over that.\u201D\\nPlatforms offering AI
      agents, such as n8n, Gemini Agent Studio, Make.com and Zapier, democratize agent
      development, Dheendsa said, enabling[construction professionals] to build custom
      automations without extensive coding expertise.\\nGenerative development tools
      like Lovable AI and Cursor take it a step further by generating, modifying,
      and testing software directly from written requirements, dramatically[reducing
      the time] typically spent on planning and manual coding.\\n[![Econ Ads_Banners3.jpg.-2]]
      \\n#### Multi-Step Reasoning\\nLLMs offer a single-step response with no tools
      or actions, he explained. AI workflows follow a fixed sequence of steps and
      can connect multiple apps, but with no reasoning or judgment. An AI agent acts
      as autonomous intelligence, utilizing multi-step reasoning and tools and APIs
      to evaluate, retry, and create.\\nDheendsa offered an example of a supply chain
      coordination function with a problem: a crew of 20 is standing around doing
      nothing because the steel beams haven\u2019t arrived.\\nThe agent can track
      supplier GPS data and manufacturing status updates in real-time, potentially
      predicting a delay three days in advance and suggesting rescheduling the crane
      rental.\\nAnother example is with a change order. A[subcontractor] might send
      bills for \u201Cextra work,\u201D and nobody remembers if it was approved, said
      Dheendsa. The agent scans thousands of emails, contracts, and meeting minutes
      automatically and verifies if the extra work was actually part of the original
      contract scope.\\n\u201CAn AI agent has the ability to make decisions,\u201D
      said Dheendsa. \u201CThe[AI agent] monitors and reports. It will detect an issue,
      and it will decide if this is an issue worthy of being brought up based on a
      criteria that you can provide it.\\n\u201CAnd then it will figure out which
      team or which person needs to be notified.\u201D\\nHe has used Replit, Lovable,
      and Cursor, and all can work to generate responses to RFPs, he said.\\n\u201CYou
      just copy the[RFP] into the Lovable app, and the software is done,\u201D said
      Dheendsa.\\n\u201CIf you have an idea, if you want to build an app, you don\u2019t
      even need to know how to code. You just put your idea in there, and it\u2019ll
      just generate you an app or a web app, website, whatever you need.\u201D\\nHuman
      in the Loop\\nDheendsa stressed that users still need to keep a \u201Chuman
      in the loop.\u201D\\n\u201CIt is prone to making mistakes. It is prone to hallucinations,
      (but) it\u2019s getting better.\u201D\\nWith Gemini 3, for example, \u201CI\u2019d
      say it\u2019s 85 per cent there. It\u2019s very good.\u201D\\nAnother caveat
      is that users should not venture into AI solutions if the original process is
      flawed: \u201CDon\u2019t automate broken processes,\u201D Dheendsa said.\\nAmong
      various risks he identified, \u201Cover-trust risk\u201D is highly dangerous,
      he said. Al confidence does not equal correctness. Always verify technical outputs
      and cross-check against standards and codes, he said.\\nMicrosoft has reported[construction
      jobs] in the field are among the least threatened by AI, Dheendsa noted in an
      interview, for a couple of reasons.\\nFor one, dredge operators or crane operators
      represent a lot of \u201Cmoving parts.\u201D Second, he said, there hasn\u2019t
      been enough data collected in the field for[AI to automate].\\n\u201CThe low-hanging
      fruit is here with the administrative stuff, like data entry and all the[repetitive
      workflows]. So let\u2019s just start there,\u201D said Dheendsa.\\n\u201CThe
      barrier to entry is lower than ever before\u2026I encourage people to start
      doing that, because even if it\u2019s not going to get you 100 per cent of the
      way there, it\u2019ll at least get you 80 per cent.\u201D\\n#### About ConstructConnect\\nAt[ConstructConnect],

      > > Abstract:\\n> This technical brief introduces Deep Agent, an advanced autonomous
      AI system designed to manage complex multi-phase tasks through a novel hierarchical
      task management architecture. The system&#39;s foundation is built on our Hierarchical
      Task DAG (HTDAG) framework, which dynamically decomposes high-level objectives
      into manageable sub-tasks while rigorously maintaining dependencies and execution
      coherence. Deep Agent advances beyond traditional agent systems through three
      key innovations: First, it implements a recursive two-stage planner-executor
      architecture that enables continuous task refinement and adaptation as circumstances
      change. Second, it features an Autonomous API &amp; Tool Creation (AATC) system
      that automatically generates reusable components from UI interactions, substantially
      reducing operational costs for similar tasks. Third, it incorporates Prompt
      Tweaking Engine and Autonomous Prompt Feedback Learning components that optimize
      Large Language Model prompts for specific scenarios, enhancing both inference
      accuracy and operational stability. These components are integrated to form
      a service infrastructure that manages user contexts, handles complex task dependencies,
      and orchestrates end-to-end agentic workflow execution. Through this sophisticated
      architecture, Deep Agent establishes a novel paradigm in self-governing AI systems,
      demonstrating robust capability to independently handle intricate, multi-step
      tasks while maintaining consistent efficiency and reliability through continuous
      self-optimization. Subjects:|Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning

        Survey\\nCopy linkLink copied to clipboard\\n![Example pattern for mobile]
        \\n![] \\n## Summary\\n* Companies are increasing AI investments and realizing
        productivity gains, but few are transforming how work gets done.\\n* The biggest
        barrier isn\u2019t the technology; it\u2019s mindset, change readiness and
        workforce engagement.\\n* Trust lags for high-stakes use cases, underscoring
        the need for responsible AI.\\n* Few businesses are connecting agents across
        workflows and functions, yet that\u2019s where the real value lies.\\n###
        Key trends about AI agents in the enterprise\\nAI agents aren\u2019t just
        the future \u2014they\u2019re already on the job. Today, they\u2019re delivering
        real results. US companies are ramping up investments, and many are already
        seeing returns. But despite the momentum, most haven\u2019t made the bold,
        strategic shifts needed to sustain that success.\\nOf the 300 senior executives
        in our May 2025 survey, 88% say their team or business function plans to increase
        AI-related budgets in the next 12 months due to agentic AI. Seventy-nine percent
        say AI agents are already being adopted in their companies. And of those adopting
        AI agents, two-thirds (66%) say that they\u2019re delivering measurable value
        through increased productivity.\\nYet from what we\u2019re seeing in the field,
        broad adoption doesn\u2019t always mean deep impact. Many employees are using
        agentic features built into enterprise apps to speed up routine tasks \u2014surfacing
        insights, updating records, answering questions. It\u2019s a meaningful boost
        in productivity, but it stops short of transformation.\\n> > While embedded
        agents from hyperscalers and model providers are seeing strong uptake, the
        real opportunity is still ahead. Reports of full adoption often reflect excitement
        about what agentic capabilities could enable \u2014not evidence of widespread
        transformation.\\n> > That\u2019s beginning to shift. Multi-agent models are
        emerging as a powerful next step \u2014systems of AI agents working in concert
        to deliver tangible results. These agents can take on complex, cross-functional
        workflows across finance, customer service, software development, R&amp;D
        and more.\\nAI isn\u2019t just another technology, as more and more executives
        recognize. Three-quarters (75%) agree or strongly agree that AI agents will
        reshape the workplace more than the internet did. What\u2019s more, 71% agree
        that AI agents are advancing so quickly that artificial general intelligence
        (AGI), in which AI can think, learn and solve problems as broadly and flexibly
        as a human, will be a reality within two years.\\nWith the potential for disruption
        growing, playing it safe isn\u2019t a strategy. To lead with AI, you need
        to move with intention. Our survey reveals four areas that demand your attention.\\n##
        1. Budgets are surging\\nAlmost nine out of 10 executives surveyed (88%) say
        their companies plan to up their AI-related budgets this year due to agentic
        AI. Over a quarter plan increases of 26% or more, likely to pay for ambitious
        plans.\\n> > Of those companies adopting AI agents, 35% say they\u2019re doing
        so broadly, while another 17% say AI agents are being fully adopted in almost
        all workflows and functions.\\n> > Still, most (68%) report that half or fewer
        of their employees interact with agents in their everyday work. Few have the
        kind of agentic workflows that a[leading hospitality company] we worked with
        has already put in place. There, employees and customers engage with teams
        of AI agents working across functions \u2014enhancing experiences, improving
        speed and driving down costs.\\nThis is a real-world example of multi-agent
        models in action \u2014AI agents working together to deliver meaningful outcomes.
        While this is already delivering significant value for one company, it signals
        what\u2019s next for many others.\\n## 2. Measurable value is here\\nIf your
        company is like most, leadership (and other stakeholders) want AI results
        now \u2014increased revenue, lower costs or other concrete value \u2014and
        AI agents are delivering. Of those adopting AI agents, nearly two-thirds (66%)
        report increased productivity. Over half (57%) report cost savings, faster

        of IntouchCX Team] IntouchCX Team\\n* April 8, 2025\\n![] \\nThe integration
        of AI into everyday business operations has reached a turning point. In 2024,
        AI models became smarter and more efficient; in 2025, the focus shifts from
        intelligence to action. AI agents are no longer just responsive tools\u2014they
        are autonomous systems capable of executing complex workflows, making strategic
        decisions, and seamlessly integrating into business operations to enhance
        productivity and efficiency across industries, reshaping the way businesses
        operate and setting new standards for automation and collaboration.\\nFrom
        Chatbots to Fully Autonomous AI Agents\\nThe transition from conversational
        AI to AI agents is a game-changer. While traditional AI models like chatbots
        primarily generate text and answer questions, AI agents go further by taking
        independent actions based on contextual understanding. These agents can schedule
        meetings, manage workflows, analyze large datasets, and even navigate the
        web to perform complex tasks without human intervention.\\n[**The future of
        AI isn&#8217;t just smarter chatbots\u2014it&#8217;s fully autonomous AI agents
        that anticipate needs, execute tasks, and continuously learn from interactions.**]
        This shift is transforming the way businesses operate, integrating AI agents
        into daily workflows and leveraging advancements in AI orchestration, where
        multiple agents collaborate in enterprise settings. Instead of relying on
        a single AI model, businesses will deploy specialized AI agents fine-tuned
        for different roles\u2014whether handling customer service inquiries, managing
        supply chains, or optimizing marketing campaigns.\\n**The Business Impact
        of AI Agents**\\nThe adoption of AI agents will transform industries by boosting
        efficiency and scalability. Companies deploying these autonomous systems expect
        significant productivity gains, with early estimates suggesting up to a 30%
        increase in operational efficiency.\\n**Key benefits include:**\\n* **Task
        Automation:**AI agents will handle repetitive and time-consuming processes,
        allowing employees to focus on strategic initiatives.\\n* **Scalability:**Businesses
        can expand operations without proportionally increasing costs, as AI agents
        streamline workflows.\\n* **Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities:**Beyond text-based
        interactions, AI agents will process images, audio, and video to provide richer
        insights and solutions.\\n* **AI-Powered Decision-Making:**These agents will
        leverage real-time data analysis to make informed recommendations, reducing
        the need for human oversight in routine decision-making.\\nThe Emergence of
        Multi-Agent Systems\\nAs businesses scale AI adoption, they will transition
        from using single AI agents to deploying coordinated teams of specialized
        agents. These AI-powered &#8220;swarms&#8221; will work in tandem, breaking
        down complex workflows into manageable steps.\\nFor example, an enterprise
        AI ecosystem might consist of:\\n* A scheduling agent that coordinates meetings
        based on team availability.\\n* A customer support agent that resolves inquiries
        in real time.\\n* A research agent that scans market trends and generates
        reports.\\nThis interconnected approach enhances efficiency while ensuring
        that AI-driven processes remain dynamic and adaptable to real-world business
        needs.\\nAI Agents and Human Oversight\\nDespite their autonomy, AI agents
        will not operate in isolation. Human oversight remains crucial for handling
        high-stakes decisions, ethical considerations, and complex problem-solving.
        The challenge for businesses in 2025 will be striking the right balance between
        automation and human intervention, ensuring that AI-driven processes remain
        accountable and aligned with organizational goals.\\nThe Future of AI Agents
        in Enterprise Workflows\\nLooking ahead, AI agents have the potential to become
        an integral part of the workforce. As regulations catch up with rapid technological
        advancements, businesses must navigate new frameworks for AI governance, data
        security, and ethical AI deployment.\\nWith AI orchestration tools streamlining
        operations and new protocols enabling seamless integration with third-party
        technologies, AI agents will redefine what\u2019s possible in automation.
        From handling routine administrative tasks to driving strategic decision-making,
        these digital co-workers are set to revolutionize productivity, efficiency,
        and innovation across industries.\\nHowever, AI cannot operate in isolation\u2014human
        involvement remains essential to ensure accuracy, ethical decision-making,
        and empathetic customer interactions. By automating repetitive processes,
        AI frees up agents to focus on complex problem-solving and emotionally intelligent
        engagements, enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\nAI agents
        are not just the next step in automation\u2014they are the future of work.

        vs. reality\\nIt\u2019s impossible to take two steps across the tech media
        landscape without stumbling over an article hailing 2025 as the year of the[AI
        agent]. Agents, we\u2019re told, will transform the way work is done, impacting
        every facet of our lives, personal and professional.\\nWe\u2019d barely surfaced
        from a landslide of NFT and crypto hype that characterized the early 2020s,
        and the metaverse bubble that followed, before media voices began singing
        the praises of[generative AI] (gen AI) in the wake of releases such as OpenAI\u2019s[GPT]
        model family, Anthropic\u2019s[Claude] and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.\\nWhile
        the chorus hasn\u2019t moved on entirely, the focus in 2025 has shifted from[large
        language models (LLMs)] to advancements in the ostensibly autonomous[artificial
        intelligence (AI)] agents ushering in the future of work.\\nDespite a momentary
        surge in gen AI interest around[Deepseek] \u2019s R1, which promised significant
        performance improvements over ChatGPT, the dominant innovation narrative in
        2025 is the AI agent.\\nMedia coverage highlights the promises of innovation,[automation]
        and efficiency agents will bring, but how much of the conversation is click-hungry
        hype?\\nThe ad-supported media world thrives on clicks, and it\u2019s reasonable
        to expect sensational, attention-grabbing headlines crafted to garner yours.
        But what can we realistically expect from[agentic AI] in 2025, and how will
        it affect our lives?\\nWe spoke with several IBM experts to cut through the
        hype, with the goal of holding a more reasonable conversation about AI agents
        and what they\u2019re going to do. Our team of informed insiders includes:\\n*

        more information.\\n## What are AI agents?\\nAn AI agent is a software program
        capable of acting autonomously to understand, plan and execute tasks. AI agents
        are powered by LLMs and can interface with tools, other models and other aspects
        of a system or network as needed to fulfill user goals.\\nWe\u2019re going
        beyond asking a chatbot to suggest a dinner recipe based on the available
        ingredients in the fridge. Agents are more than automated[customer experience]
        emails that inform you it\u2019ll be a few days until a real-world human can
        get to your inquiry.\\n[AI agents differ from traditional AI assistants] that
        need a prompt each time they generate a response. In theory, a user gives
        an agent a high-level task, and the agent figures out how to complete it.\\nCurrent
        offerings are still in the early stages of approaching this idea. \u201CWhat\u2019s
        commonly referred to as \u2018agents\u2019 in the market is the addition of
        rudimentary planning and tool-calling (sometimes called function calling)
        capabilities to LLMs,\u201D says Ashoori. \u201CThese enable the LLM to break
        down complex tasks into smaller steps that the LLM can perform.\u201D\\nHay
        is optimistic that more robust agents are on the way: \u201CYou wouldn\u2019t
        need any further progression in models today to build[future AI agents],\u201D
        he says.\\nWith that out of the way, what\u2019s the conversation about agents

        how AI agents integrate with databases and external tools to enhance problem-solving
        capabilities and adaptability.\\n[\\nLearn more\\n] \\n## Narrative 1: 2025
        is the year of the AI agent\\n\u201CMore and better agents\u201D are on the
        way, predicts Time.[1] \u201CAutonomous \u2018agents\u2019 and profitability
        are likely to dominate the artificial intelligence agenda,\u201D reports Reuters.[2]
        \u201CThe age of agentic AI has arrived,\u201D promises Forbes, in response
        to a claim from Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang.[3] \\nTech media is awash with
        assurances that our lives are on the verge of a total transformation. Autonomous
        agents are poised to streamline and alter our jobs, drive optimization and
        accompany us in our daily lives, handling our mundanities in real time and
        freeing us up for creative pursuits and other higher-level tasks.\\n### 2025
        as the year of agentic exploration\\n\u201CIBM and Morning Consult did a survey
        of 1,000 developers who are building AI applications for enterprise, and 99%
        of them said they are exploring or developing AI agents,\u201D\_explains Ashoori.
        \u201CSo yes, the answer is that 2025 is going to be the year of the agent.\u201D
        However, that declaration is not without nuance.\\nAfter establishing the
        current market conception of agents as LLMs with function calling, Ashoori
        draws a distinction between that idea and truly autonomous agents. \u201CThe
        true definition [of an AI agent] is an intelligent entity with reasoning and
        planning capabilities that can autonomously take action. Those reasoning and
        planning capabilities are up for discussion. It depends on how you define
        that.\u201D\\n\u201CI definitely see AI agents heading in this direction,
        but we\u2019re not fully there yet,\u201D says Gajjar. \u201CRight now, we\u2019re
        seeing early glimpses\u2014AI agents can already analyze data, predict trends
        and automate workflows to some extent. But building AI agents that can autonomously
        handle complex decision-making will take more than just better algorithms.
        We\u2019ll need big leaps in contextual reasoning and testing for edge cases,\u201D
        she adds.\\nDanilevsky isn\u2019t convinced that this is anything new. \u201CI&#39;m
        still struggling to truly believe that this is all that different from just
        orchestration,\u201D she says. \u201CYou&#39;ve renamed orchestration, but
        now it&#39;s called agents, because that&#39;s the cool word. But orchestration
        is something that we&#39;ve been doing in programming forever.\u201D\\nWith
        regard to 2025 being the year of the agent, Danilevsky is skeptical. \u201CIt
        depends on what you say an agent is, what you think an agent is going to accomplish
        and what kind of value you think it will bring,\u201D she says. \u201CIt&#39;s
        quite a statement to make when we haven&#39;t even yet figured out ROI (return
        on investment) on LLM technology more generally.\u201D\\nAnd it\u2019s not
        just the business side that has her hedging her bets. \u201CThere&#39;s the
        hype of imagining if this thing could think for you and make all these decisions
        and take actions on your computer. Realistically, that&#39;s terrifying.\u201D\\nDanilevsky
        frames the disconnect as one of miscommunication. \u201C[Agents] tend to be
        very ineffective because humans are very bad communicators. We still can&#39;t
        get chat agents to interpret what you want correctly all the time.\u201D\\nStill,
        the forthcoming year holds a lot of promise as an era of experimentation.
        \u201CI&#39;m a big believer in [2025 as the year of the agent],\u201D says
        Hay excitedly.\\nEvery large tech company and hundreds of startups are now
        experimenting with agents. Salesforce, for example, has released their Agentforce
        platform, which enables users to create agents that are easily integrated
        within the Salesforce app ecosystem.\\n\u201CThe wave is coming and we&#39;re
        going to have a lot of agents. It&#39;s still a very nascent ecosystem, so
        I think a lot of people are going to build agents, and they&#39;re going to
        have a lot of fun.\u201D\\n## Narrative 2: Agents can handle highly complex
        tasks on their own\\nThis narrative assumes that today\u2019s agents meet
        the theoretical definition outlined in the introduction to this piece. 2025\u2019s
        agents will be fully autonomous AI programs that can scope out a project and
        complete it with all the necessary tools they need and with no help from human
        partners. But what\u2019s missing from this narrative is nuance.\\n### Today\u2019s
        models are more than enough\\nHay believes that the groundwork has already
        been laid for such developments. \u201CThe big thing about agents is that
        they have the ability to plan,\u201D he outlines. \u201CThey have the ability
        to reason, to use tools and perform tasks, and they need to do it at speed
        and scale.\u201D\\nHe cites 4 developments that, compared to the best models
        of 12 to 18 months ago, mean that the models of early 2025 can power the agents
        envisioned by the proponents of this narrative:\\n* Better, faster, smaller
        models\\n* Chain-of-thought (COT) training\\n* Increased context windows\\n*
        Function calling\\n\u201CNow, most of these things are in play,\u201D Hay
        continues. \u201CYou can have the AI call tools. It can plan. It can reason
        and come back with good answers. It can use inference-time compute. You\u2019ll
        have better chains of thought and more memory to work with. It&#39;s going
        to run fast. It\u2019s going to be cheap. That leads you to a structure where
        I think you can have agents. The models are improving and they&#39;re getting
        better, so that&#39;s only going to accelerate.\u201D\\n### Realistic expectations
        are a must\\nAshoori is careful to differentiate between what agents will
        be able to do later, and what they can do now. \u201CThere is the promise,
        and there is what the agent&#39;s capable of doing today,\u201D she says.
        \u201CI would say the answer depends on the use case. For simple use cases,
        the agents are capable of [choosing the correct tool], but for more sophisticated
        use cases, the technology\",\"image\":\"https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/gbs/cf/ul/g/5a/88/336.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.1280.1280.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/adobe-cms/default-images/icon-32x32.png\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.druidai.com/blog/top-tried-and-tested-use-cases-for-autonomous-ai-agents-in-2025\",\"title\":\"Top

        your calendar reminding you of a meeting, then booking the room, sending the
        brief, gathering the right people, and following up afterward with action
        items. Ok, your calendar cannot do all of that; that\u2019s what an autonomous
        AI agent brings to the table. It doesn\u2019t just notify you. It thinks,
        acts, and makes things happen in the background so you don\u2019t have to.\\nThese
        aren\u2019t glorified chatbots. They\u2019re your new smart digital coworkers,
        always on, never confused, and constantly improving with every task they complete.
        Whether it\u2019s streamlining finance, simplifying HR, supporting students,
        or managing supply chains, AI agents are already embedded in the workflows
        that matter.\\nLet\u2019s explore the real-world use cases showing why these
        agents are the backbone of affordable, scalable automation, and why they\u2019re
        becoming a must-have in every enterprise playbook.\\n## Why 2025 Wasthe Year

        designed with orchestration, security, and lifecycle management in mind, become
        more than tools; they become proactive team members who get things done.\\nAnd
        the ROI? It\u2019s compelling. Studies point to 30\u201380% improvements in
        speed, accuracy, and cost savings across industries when deploying agentic
        AI workflows. Let's dig into what these agents are actually doing in the real
        world.\\n## Most In-Demand Use Cases for Autonomous AI Agents in 2025\\nAs
        more organizations shift from static automation to intelligent systems that
        adapt, decide, and execute, autonomous AI agents are stepping into roles once
        handled by multiple tools, and sometimes, entire teams. These agents aren\u2019t
        just supporting workflows; they\u2019re running them from start to finish.
        What was once limited to isolated tasks is now evolving into coordinated,
        cross-functional processes.\\nBelow are the most in-demand, high-impact use

        Digital Coworkers\\nWhile many businesses start exploring[autonomous AI agents
        for efficiency], the real payoff goes far beyond shaving minutes off a task.
        When implemented with orchestration, secure integrations, and lifecycle visibility,
        these agents transform how work gets done, and who does it.\\nHere\u2019s
        what they really bring to the table:\\n### Always-On Productivity with Autonomous
        AI Agents\\nOne of the most immediate benefits of autonomous AI agents is
        their 24/7 availability. Unlike human teams, they don\u2019t sleep, get overloaded,
        or miss an email. These smart digital coworkers keep processes moving around
        the clock, whether it\u2019s answering internal HR questions at 2 AM or processing
        invoices over the weekend. This uninterrupted productivity reduces lag, accelerates
        workflows, and allows your teams to stay focused on higher-value work.\\n###
        Contextual Decision-Making Using Gen AI and Agentic Execution\\nSmart automation
        isn\u2019t about doing things faster, it\u2019s about doing them better.[Autonomous
        AI agents equipped with generative AI] can understand the nuance behind a
        request, while agentic workflows give them the power to act on that insight.
        This combination allows agents to make decisions based on user history, policy
        data, and workflow context, resulting in responses and actions that are not
        just accurate, but relevant and timely.\\n### End-to-End Automation Through
        Integrated AI Agent Workflows\\nModern enterprises don\u2019t need point solutions,
        they need systems that can handle tasks from start to finish. AI agents shine
        in end-to-end automation, managing everything from initiation to validation,
        updates, and closure. Whether it\u2019s onboarding a new employee, processing
        a refund, or handling a service request, these agents coordinate actions across
        systems to ensure no task is dropped mid-stream.\\n### Real ROI with Scalable,
        Low-Overhead AI Agents\\nIt\u2019s not just about speed or intelligence. It\u2019s
        about impact. Autonomous AI agents offer a clear return on investment by reducing
        reliance on manual labor, minimizing errors, and increasing process consistency.
        With fewer tools needed to complete a workflow, less strain on human teams,
        and faster time-to-value, these agents prove their worth quickly. And because
        they\u2019re modular, they scale with your business, without spiraling complexity
        or cost.\\n### Smarter Over Time: Learning and Adapting as They Work\\nThe
        value of smart digital coworkers compounds over time. These agents don\u2019t
        just perform, they learn. With every task, they gather more data, improve
        accuracy, and adapt to new business logic or user behavior. As your business
        evolves, your agents evolve with it, offering a level of continuity and improvement
        that static workflows simply can\u2019t match.\\n## Complete Industry Use-Case

        in 2025\\nMarketing teams face unprecedented complexity as campaigns span
        multiple channels, require real-time optimization, and demand[personalized
        experiences] at scale. Traditional automation tools execute predefined tasks
        but lack the intelligence to adapt strategies when market conditions shift
        or customer behaviors change unexpectedly.\\nA new generation of AI technology
        promises to transform how organizations plan campaigns and collaborate with
        clients. These autonomous systems analyze vast amounts of data, make strategic
        decisions, and execute[complex workflows] without constant human oversight
        \u2014fundamentally changing the relationship between marketers and their
        technology stack.\\nThe shift from reactive automation to proactive intelligence
        represents more than incremental improvement. The global AI agent market was
        estimated at[$5.40 billion] in 2024 and is forecast to reach $50.31 billion
        by 2030, representing explosive growth driven by expanding enterprise adoption.
        Organizations deploying these advanced AI capabilities report efficiency gains
        of 30-50%, dramatic reductions in campaign optimization cycles, and enhanced
        client satisfaction through real-time transparency and strategic insights.\\nAutonomous
        AI agents are intelligent systems designed to work independently, performing
        tasks such as campaign planning and client collaboration without constant
        human oversight. They leverage machine learning to adapt and execute complex
        strategies, enhancing efficiency and creativity in marketing initiatives.
        These agents integrate with external tools, retrieve relevant information,
        and adapt to dynamic environments through sophisticated reasoning architectures.
        Companies implementing marketing automation, including autonomous agent components,
        achieve average returns of $5.44 for every $1 invested, translating to[544%]
        return on investment over three years.\\n## What are autonomous AI agents?\\nAutonomous

        These agents integrate with external tools, retrieve relevant information,
        and adapt to dynamic environments through sophisticated reasoning architectures.
        Among companies currently deploying AI agents,[66%] report increased productivity
        while over half report cost savings (57%), faster decision-making (55%), and
        improved customer experience (54%).\\nAutonomous AI agents are intelligent

        every day reported that[33.5%] saved four hours or more per week, compared
        with only 11.5% of those using it only one day per week, showing a direct
        correlation between AI usage intensity and productivity gains.\\nUnlike traditional
        marketing automation that follows rigid &quot;if-then&quot; logic, autonomous
        agents process multiple signals simultaneously and adjust their approach based
        on context. They observe their environment, make decisions, and take actions
        to achieve specific marketing objectives \u2014whether that means optimizing

        by 2034], registering a strong CAGR of43.4%during the forecast period. This
        explosive growth is driven by rapid enterprise adoption, continuous advancements
        in artificial intelligence, and the expansion of automation across diverse
        industries. North America is expected to command the largest market share
        in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global market.\\nThis comprehensive guide
        explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals, applications, and 2025
        developments, providing essential insights for businesses, developers, and
        decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are Autonomous AI
        Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents are self-governing
        systems that operate independently without constant human intervention, making
        decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals using machine learning
        and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents] represent a significant
        leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence
        that requires explicit programming for every scenario, autonomous agents possess
        the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent decisions based on their
        environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine learning], natural
        language processing, and real-time data analysis to create intelligent entities
        that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For example:**Learners
        today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform], which uses these
        same principles to personalize instruction, track progress, and respond dynamically
        to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents behave in complex
        business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their autonomy \u2013the
        ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions,
        and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This independence
        makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate complex
        processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
        delivery around the clock.\\n#####\",\"image\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Are-Autonomous-AI-Agents-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025.webp\",\"favicon\":\"https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-05-2-150x150.webp\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/agentic-ai-operating-model\",\"title\":\"Agentic

        Rethinking how work works with agentic AI\\nAs companies continue to explore
        how to perform better with artificial intelligence, a cohort of executives
        are asking a question that goes far beyond simple deployment: \\\"What if
        we rebuild our entire operating model around AI?\\\"\\nA growing number already
        are\u2014and they're creating business outcomes that were previously impossible.\\nThese
        leaders aren't just implementing AI tools\u2014they're pioneering entirely
        new operating models around autonomous decision-making. The radical premise:
        that agentic AI systems will make an increasing number of decisions, while
        humans make the decisions that matter most, preserving human agency and expertise
        where it is most crucial.\\nThe performance gap is widening rapidly. These
        transformation-driven organizations are creating net-new business capabilities,
        fundamentally changing what's possible at enterprise scale.\\n|||||\\n|By||By||\\n|2027||2030||\\n|twice
        as many executives expect AI agents will make autonomous decisions in processes
        and workflows compared to today.||fully autonomous robotic systems with embodied
        AI will be operational realities across industries.||\\n|||||\\nThe companies
        winning in the autonomous AI future won't be those that simply deploy the
        most sophisticated AI agents. They'll be the organizations that abandon existing
        operating models for entirely new ones designed around autonomous decision-making
        capabilities.\\nIn the emerging AI transition, speed matters, but not all
        efforts are equal. Some organizations are reaching truly strategic peaks while
        others chase tactical AI.\\nTo better understand the real-world impact of
        autonomous AI, the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM IBV) surveyed 800
        C-suite executives in 20 countries across 19 industries. This report reveals
        key elements of an autonomous AI operating model \u2013from management mindset
        to workforce evolution to the role of trust and transparency. Alongside, we
        highlight changing team structures, and examples of specific operating model
        transformations in progress.\\nWe finish with an action guide that synthesizes
        what to do now to build a synergistic operating model that can optimize agentic
        AI\u2019s competitive benefits.\\n**Measurable impact: AI is expected to drive
        double-digit improvements across the enterprise**\\n![A chart showing results
        from IBM\u2019s own AI journey in business operations, as well as forecasted
        metrics from non-IBM executives by 2027.] \\n**Perspective**\\nAgentic AI\u2019s
        split screen\\nIn this recent survey of C-suite operational executives, we
        uncovered a fascinating divergence in how companies are approaching agentic
        AI. We asked two very telling questions, which revealed a sharp divide in
        strategic focus.\\nFirst, we asked what percentage of their agentic AI initiatives
        were focused on improving existing processes and how successful they were.\\nSecond,
        we asked what percentage of their agentic AI initiatives were designed to
        create entirely new workflow capabilities and how successful they were.\\nThe
        responses divided our respondents into two distinct groups.\\n**The process-focused**\\nThis
        group is technically getting it done; they're laser-focused on optimizing
        existing workflows and are achieving measurable business impact. In short,
        they are proficient at efficiency, but they have yet to crack the code on
        true transformation.\\n**The transformation-driven**\\nThis more strategic
        cohort is advancing agentic AI with a dual mandate. They are not only improving
        existing workflows, but they are also successfully creating and building net-new
        capabilities. Their vision extends beyond optimization; they are actively
        reimagining their operating model. The data shows it's working. They are achieving
        real-world value of AI and automation across their business operations.\\n###
        AI transformation isn\u2019t a forecast, it\u2019s a deadline\\nToday, 24%
        of executives say that AI agents take independent action in their organization.
        By 2027, 67% expect that to be the case. Similarly, twice as many executives
        expect autonomous decision-making from agentic AI in processes and workflows
        by 2027 (57%) compared to today (28%). Even in highly regulated areas, transformation-driven
        organizations are moving fast \u2014executives expect agentic AI to automate
        an average of 29% of risk and compliance operations by 2027.And many anticipate
        that AI agents will automate the innovation process itself, with 19% of executives
        saying that is happening today and 48% of executives expecting this level
        of innovation-related automation in 2027.\\nThese benchmarks represent a fundamental
        change in the DNA of business. It\u2019s no wonder that:\\n> 78% of our respondents
        agree that achieving maximum benefit from agentic AI requires a new operating
        model.\\nAmid global economic uncertainty, 69% of them report a pressing need
        to develop more agentic AI-enabled predictive and simulation modeling capabilities\u2014for
        example, for financial forecasting, human resource talent and skilling analysis,
        dynamic transportation and distribution routing and scheduling, and proactive
        mitigation strategies with built-in resilience.\\nCustomer-touching operations
        have emerged as primary arenas for agentic AI implementation. Organizations
        are prioritizing sales forecasting, dynamic pricing based on inventory scenarios,
        and intelligent customer order processing\u2014areas where autonomous system
        intelligence can deliver immediate competitive advantages and measurable returns.\\nThe
        appetite for change is real, but a critical chasm exists between aspiration
        and execution. The vast majority of AI investment\u201478%, has been funneled
        into improving existing processes. This is the difference between optimization
        and transformation. Process-focused organizations are stuck in a loop of making
        their current operations better, rather than making transformative leaps a
        reality.\\n#### How decision-makers think differently about agentic AI\\nThe
        organizations achieving genuine transformation are those that view agentic
        AI not as a tool to do existing work faster but as a catalyst to do entirely
        new work efficiently. Consider the compliance challenge: in highly regulated
        industries, agentic AI isn\u2019t just flagging risks \u2014it\u2019s using
        teams of specialized agents to continuously scan, interpret, and act on regulatory
        changes across multiple jurisdictions and industries. Imagine one set of agents
        monitoring shifting financial rules in Europe, another tracking evolving trade
        sanctions in Asia, and yet another adjusting healthcare compliance workflows
        in the U.S. All of them work in concert, automatically updating communications,
        documentation, and approval processes in real time. The result? Risks can
        be mitigated before they materialize, compliance teams spend less time on
        repetitive reviews, and organizations can operate more confidently across
        geographies without drowning in legal complexity.\\n> Because they are focused
        on developing net-new capabilities, transformative organizations are asking
        different questions: What becomes possible when systems can make decisions
        autonomously?\\nAs well as: How do we redesign our value creation processes
        around this capability? These enterprises must also recognize the shifting
        landscape AI commoditization is driving. In other words, the window for first-mover
        advantages in process innovations is narrowing. Therefore, while investing
        in current operations isn't to be underestimated, the true key to competitive
        differentiation now lies in bold, transformative leaps forward.\\nThe measurement
        gap reveals this strategic divide clearly. Only 42% of the process-oriented
        organizations identified in our analysis have developed new key performance
        indicators (KPIs) to monitor AI agents' impact on business targets, compared
        to nearly half of transformational organizations (see Action Guide for examples
        of new KPIs). These leaders aren't just implementing agentic AI automation\u2014they're
        measuring different outcomes entirely.\\n> \u201CWhen you don\u2019t have
        good, objective KPIs, older ones take over. We see that technology is often
        deployed around creating improvements with the infrastructure you currently
        have.\u201D&nbsp;\\n**> Board advisor,\\n**> &nbsp;\\n> United Kingdom\\n**Perspective**\\nPlug

        in workplace productivity\\nTONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation\\nBy
        Jialu Shan and[Michael R. Wade] \\n**September 2025\\nIn December 2023, we
        launched our first \u201C*Gen AI for Better Productivity*\u201D framework
        with 12 categories. At the time, the conversation was dominated by familiar
        use cases: chatbots that could handle customer queries, tools that could generate
        content at scale, image generation, and systems capable of accelerating code
        development. Soon after, we added new categories for transcription, translation
        and localization, capabilities that quickly proved their utility in everyday
        workflows. We have continued to update the framework with new tools.\\nFor
        this update, we\u2019re adding a pivotal new category:**Agentic AI**. This
        addition signals that business and technology leaders now see autonomous AI
        agents as a distinct productivity paradigm: a transformative shift in how
        we think about AI in the workplace.\\nBefore turning to this new frontier,
        it\u2019s worth pausing to look at the AI applications that have already proven
        their value. These tools have moved well beyond novelty and are now woven
        into daily workflows.\\n![ - IMD Business School] \\n#### Continuity in core
        capabilities\\nAI has changed how we work, and the tools we use are here to
        stay. What began as experiments are now indispensable parts of our routines.\\n######
        **Generative content creation:**\\nAI tools that create and edit text, images,
        presentations, and videos have become a huge part of our work lives. A[Microsoft
        survey] found 75% of global knowledge workers already use generative AI at
        work. Most users say AI saves them time (90%), helps them focus on more important
        tasks (85%), and makes them more creative (84%). We&#8217;ve come a long way
        from worrying that AI would stifle our creativity. In fact, a[2024 marketing
        report] found that 15% of marketing teams &#8220;couldn&#8217;t live without
        AI&#8221; because it made everyday tasks like creating presentations and transcribing
        audio so much faster and smoother.\\n###### **Knowledge work and communication:**\\nAI
        is also transforming how we handle information and communication. Companies
        now use advanced chatbots for customer service and internal helpdesks, dramatically
        improving response times. AI-powered research assistants can sift through
        documents and summarize key findings in seconds, tasks that once took humans
        hours of painstaking work. The impact on software development has been equally
        transformative. A study by[MIT Sloan, Microsoft Research, and GitHub] found
        that generative AI coding tools can reduce programming time by 56%, allowing
        developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving rather than routine implementation.\\n######
        **Task automation:**\\nDaily tasks like managing email and scheduling meetings
        are now so much easier thanks to AI. Modern email assistants can sort your
        inbox and draft responses, and AI schedulers can find optimal meeting times
        without endless back-and-forth among participants. These tools have begun
        to seriously alleviate our digital overload. A[McKinsey report] estimated
        work automation with GenAI and other technologies could boost productivity
        growth 0.5 to 3.4% annually.\\nThe foundational uses of AI for productivity
        have proven resilient and enduring. However, the competitive landscape continues
        to evolve rapidly, with some companies rebranding (you\u2019ll notice the
        fresh logos in our graph) or pivoting their focus as the market matures. Take
        Tome: once a specialized presentation tool, it has shifted toward building
        enterprise solutions, reflecting shifting market dynamics and heightened competition
        in an increasingly crowded field.\\n#### **The new frontier: Agentic AI**\\nIf
        generative AI is about extending human capability, Agentic AI is about autonomous
        execution. Agentic AI refers to systems that can delegate, act, and learn
        on their own to accomplish a goal. Instead of waiting for precise, step-by-step
        prompts, an AI agent can take a high-level request like, \u201COrganize a
        one-day offsite for my team next month,\u201D and then navigate multiple tasks
        and tools to fulfil it. Agentic AI tools today can check calendars, research
        options, book venues, schedule travel, and draft agenda.\\n[Over a quarter
        of business leaders] say their organizations are already exploring agentic
        AI to a significant degree. The vision is for these agents to process different
        types of data (text, images, voice), coordinate with other AI services, and
        learn from experience to reliably execute complex tasks. Emerging platforms
        show the breadth of possibilities:**Manus**is a general AI agent that bridges
        thoughts into actions, designed to independently carry out complex real-world
        tasks without direct or continuous human guidance. Similarly,**Beam**focuses
        on simplifying data workflows and**Sana**&#8216;s AI agents are revolutionizing
        enterprise search and knowledge management.**Stack AI**allows teams to stitch

        agentic category, agentic modes of the frontier models, like**ChatGPT**and**Claude**are
        also starting to make waves.\\nThis doesn\u2019t mean companies are relinquishing
        full control. Early trials often keep a human &#8220;in the loop&#8221; to
        supervise. But the momentum is undeniable. Tech strategists now talk about
        an &#8220;AI workforce&#8221;: a concept that emphasizes augmentation, not
        replacement: AI agents as teammates rather than substitutes. For forward-looking
        firms, this means new opportunities to streamline operations, from an AI agent
        that triages IT support tickets overnight to one that summarizes market intelligence
        for a strategy team.\\n#### **The bigger picture**\\nAI has quickly moved
        from a novelty to a necessity in workplaces worldwide. The[same Microsoft
        survey] mentioned earlier found that 79% of business leaders say their company
        must adopt AI to stay competitive. This represents a generational consensus
        that AI has transitioned from &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; to &#8220;must-have&#8221;
        status.\\nThe goal across all these domains is not simply to do more work.
        It&#8217;s to free up our time and mental energy for what truly matters: the
        strategic, creative, and interpersonal aspects of work and life that AI cannot
        as easily replace. In just one year, AI&#8217;s role in productivity has grown
        from a set of practical tools to a broader ecosystem that includes emerging
        &#8220;colleague&#8221; agents. Yet, the mission remains consistent: to reduce
        friction and enable people to focus on what they do best.\\nThe AI landscape
        will undoubtedly keep evolving, but the lesson is already clear: the toolbox
        is expanding, and those who adopt thoughtfully will move not just with the
        tide, but ahead of it.\\nShare\\n![Share] \\nGet shareable link\\nCopy\\n[]

        Abstract\\n\\nThis qualitative content analysis examines how organizations
        can strategically integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous agents
        to enhance operational efficiency, ensure legal and ethical compliance, and
        foster workforce adaptability. Drawing on recent industry reports (e.g., Fujitsu,
        2025; McKinsey & Company, 2024), academic studies (e.g., Giorgetti et al.,
        2025), and regulatory frameworks (e.g., NIST, 2023), we document significant
        operational gains attributable to AI-including cycle-time reductions of 30-85%,
        error-rate drops to below 1%, and anomalydetection accuracy reaching up to
        99%. Despite these compelling efficiency improvements, persistent challenges
        hinder widespread and responsible adoption. These include critical governance
        gaps under evolving regulations like GDPR and CCPA, the pervasive risks of
        automation bias, the potential for workforce deskilling hazards, and inherent
        technical barriers such as the explainability of \\\"black-box\\\" AI models
        and the significant environmental impact related to AI's carbon footprint.
        To address these multifaceted challenges, this paper proposes a practical
        Four-Stage Adoption Framework and a detailed Five-Step Action Plan specifically
        designed for practitioners. The findings underscore the necessity of achieving
        a delicate balance between pursuing operational efficiency gains and ensuring
        the sustainability and inclusivity of AI integration efforts within organizations.\\n\\n**Keywords:**

        fast enough.\\n### ![] \\n##### Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people
        to unlock AI\u2019s full potential\\n[(47 pages)] \\n**Artificial intelligence
        has arrived in the workplace**and has the potential to be as transformative
        as the steam engine was to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution.1\u201C[Gen
        AI: A cognitive industrial revolution],\u201D McKinsey, June 7, 2024.With
        powerful and capable large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic,
        Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we have entered a new information
        technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term AI opportunity at $4.4
        trillion in added productivity growth potential from corporate use cases.2\u201C[The
        economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier],\u201D
        McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\\nTherein lies the challenge: the long-term potential
        of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear. Over the next three
        years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments. But
        while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent of leaders
        call their companies \u201Cmature\u201D on the deployment spectrum, meaning
        that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business
        outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and
        steer their organizations closer to AI maturity.\\nThis research report, prompted
        by Reid Hoffman\u2019s book*Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with
        Our AI Future*,3Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato,*Superagency: What Could Possibly
        Go Right with Our AI Future*, Authors Equity, January 2025.asks a similar
        question: How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock
        new levels of creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive
        enormous positive and disruptive change. This transformation will take some
        time, but leaders must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly
        today to avoid becoming uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic
        and technological shifts shows that such moments can define the rise and fall
        of companies. Over 40 years ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies
        including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar
        market capitalizations. Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy
        of work and access to information. AI now is like the internet many years
        ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too
        small.\\n![] \\nThis report explores companies\u2019 technology and business
        readiness for AI adoption (see sidebar \u201CAbout the survey\u201D). It concludes
        that employees are ready for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership.\\n##
        About the survey\\n**To create our report,**we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers
        and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November
        2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came
        from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the
        United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development,
        finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology.\\nAll the survey
        findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international
        nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this
        way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide
        statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global
        findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses
        and those from other regions.\\n**Chapter 1**looks at the rapid advancement
        of technology over the past two years and its implications for business adoption
        of AI.\\n**Chapter 2**delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees
        and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than
        their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis;
        are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace
        30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills.
        Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority
        (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support. This
        is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in managerial
        roles, can be strong advocates for change.\\n![Agents, Robots, and Us] \\n###
        Agents, Robots, and Us: What executives need to know about AI and work\\n**Thursday,

        McKinsey senior partners Alexis Krivkovich and Anu Madgavkar for a discussion
        of how executives can build effective human-AI skill partnerships, prepare
        their workforces, and make strategic decisions that position their organizations
        for growth in the age of AI.\\n[Register here] \\n**Chapter 3**looks at the
        need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want
        to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees
        worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express
        greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will
        get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making
        bold and responsible decisions.\\n**Chapter 4**examines how companies risk
        losing ground in the AI race if leaders do not set bold goals. As the hype
        around AI subsides, companies should put a heightened focus on practical applications
        that empower employees in their daily jobs. These applications can create
        competitive moats and generate measurable ROI. Across industries, functions,
        and geographies, companies that invest strategically can go beyond using AI
        to drive incremental value and instead create transformative change.\\n**Chapter
        5**looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success
        with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge.
        It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address
        AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change.\\nChapter 1\\n## An innovation
        as powerful as the steam engine\\nImagine a world where machines not only
        perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions.
        This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together
        in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity
        (see sidebar \u201CAI superagency\u201D). This is the transformative potential
        of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest
        innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does
        not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions.
        Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide\u2014and
        even make\u2014decisions. That\u2019s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented
        economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It
        will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another.\\n> Scientific
        discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human
        progress.\\n> > Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner
        at Greylock Partners, and author\\nMany breakthrough technologies, including
        the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we
        live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more
        than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue,
        and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire
        proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the
        potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will
        be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that
        benefits everyone.\\n## AI superagency\\n**What impact will AI have on humanity?**Reid
        Hoffman and Greg Beato\u2019s book*Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right
        with Our AI Future*(Authors Equity, January 2025) explores this question.
        The book highlights how AI could enhance human agency and heighten our potential.
        It envisions a human-led, future-forward approach to AI.\\nSuperagency, a
        term coined by Hoffman, describes a state where individuals, empowered by
        AI, supercharge their creativity, productivity, and positive impact. Even
        those not directly engaging with AI can benefit from its broader effects on
        knowledge, efficiency, and innovation.\\nAI is the latest in a series of transformative
        supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have
        reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors,
        AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans
        can develop and deploy it safely and equitably.\\nOver the past two years,
        AI has advanced in leaps and bounds, and enterprise-level adoption has accelerated
        due to lower costs and greater access to capabilities. Many notable AI innovations
        have emerged (Exhibit 1). For example, we have seen a rapid expansion of context
        windows, or the short-term memory of LLMs. The larger a[context window], the
        more information an LLM can process at once. To illustrate, Google\u2019s
        Gemini 1.5 could process one million tokens in February 2024, while its Gemini
        1.5 Pro could process two million tokens by June of that same year.4*The Keyword*,\_\u201COur

        recent years, organizations have moved beyond \\npredictive models and chat
        interfaces to experiment \\nwith artificial intelligence (AI) in more transformative
        \\nways. AI agents are now emerging as integrated \\ncollaborators in business,
        public services and \\neveryday life. The adoption of AI agents could \\nbring
        significant gains in efficiency, altered kinds of \\nhuman-machine interaction
        and the advent of novel \\ndigital ecosystems.\\nThis transition faces multiple
        obstacles that need to be \\naddressed. Moving from models to agents represents
        \\nmore than a technical milestone and requires \\norganizations to rethink
        how they design, evaluate and \\ngovern advanced agentic systems. Many companies
        \\nare now questioning what agents can accomplish \\nalongside the practical
        steps needed to adopt and \\ndeploy them safely, responsibly and effectively.\\nThis
        paper was developed to help answer those \\nquestions. By mapping the evolving
        foundations \\nof agentic systems, classifying their roles, \\nidentifying
        new ways to evaluate them and outlining \\nprogressive governance approaches,
        the paper \\noffers practical guidance for leaders navigating \\nadoption
        in real-world contexts.\\nThrough the AI Governance Alliance, the World \\nEconomic
        Forum and Capgemini are advancing \\nthis subject in collaboration with the
        AI community, \\nsignalling that now is the time to prepare for an \\nagentic
        future. If adopters start small, iterate \\ncarefully and apply proportionate
        safeguards, \\nagents can be deployed in ways that amplify \\nhuman capabilities,
        unlock productivity and \\nestablish a foundation for more complex multi-agent
        \\necosystems to emerge over time. Unless a careful \\nand deliberate approach
        to adoption is adopted, \\nuntested use cases could outpace oversight and
        \\nlead to misaligned incentives, emergent risks and \\nloss of public trust.\\nAs
        with any transformative technology, the \\nopportunities presented by AI agents
        must be \\naccompanied by a responsibility to guide their \\ndevelopment and
        deployment with care. Through \\ncross-functional efforts and collaborative
        \\ngovernance, AI agents can be integrated in ways \\nthat amplify human ingenuity,
        promote innovation \\nand improve overall quality of life. This paper is a
        \\nstep in that direction, offering guidance to help early \\nadopters navigate
        the complex and often uneven \\npath of AI agent adoption. \\nRoshan Gya\\nChief

        summary\\nThis report has been tailored mainly for adopters \\nof AI agents,
        including decision-makers, technical \\nleaders and practitioners seeking
        to integrate AI \\nagents into organizational workflows and services. \\nWhile
        AI agents are gaining traction, there remains \\nlimited guidance on how to
        design, test and \\noversee them responsibly. This paper aims to help \\nfill
        that gap by providing a structured foundation for \\nthe safe and effective
        deployment of these systems.\\nThe paper makes three key contributions. Firstly,
        \\nit covers the technical foundations of AI agents, \\nincluding their architectures,
        protocols and security \\nconsiderations. Secondly, it offers a functional
        \\nclassification that differentiates agents by their role, \\nautonomy, authority,
        predictability and operational \\ncontext. Thirdly, it suggests a progressive
        governance \\napproach that directly connects evaluation and \\nsafeguards
        to an agent\u2019s task scope and \\ndeployment environment.\\nTogether, these
        elements guide adopters\_with a \\nconceptual blueprint for moving from experimentation\\nto
        deployment. The report highlights the importance \\nof aligning adoption with
        evaluation and governance \\npractices to ensure that AI agents are successfully
        \\ndeployed while trust, safety and accountability \\nare maintained.\\nThis
        paper explores the emergence of AI \\nagents, outlining their technical foundations,
        \\nclassification, evaluation and governance to \\nsupport safe and effective
        adoption. \\nAI Agents in Action: Foundations for Evaluation and Governance
        4\\nIntroduction\\nAI agents are gradually becoming embedded in \\nan increasing
        number of tasks, workflows and \\nuse cases that span cloud and edge computing,
        \\nleading the way to more widespread adoption. \\nAs the transition from
        prototyping to deployment \\naccelerates, current adoption remains concentrated
        \\namong early adopters. According to a recent global \\nsurvey of executives,
        82% of organizations plan to \\nintegrate agents within the next one to three
        years, \\nindicating that most efforts are still in the planning or \\npilot
        phase,1\\n while moving towards wider adoption.\\nThe concept of software
        agents has been studied \\nfor decades in fields such as robotics, autonomous
        \\nsystems and distributed computing. What is different\\ntoday is the rise
        of data-driven models, particularly \\ngenerative artificial intelligence
        (AI) and large language\\nmodels (LLMs), which are enabling the emergence
        \\nof a new generation of LLM-based agents. These \\nsystems can generate
        plans, simulate reasoning \\nand adapt their behaviour through feedback \\nmechanisms
        in ways that were previously not \\npossible. This evolution has sparked a
        new \\nwave of experimentation, with researchers and \\ncompanies rapidly
        creating prototypes of agents \\nin various fields. This report focuses mainly
        on \\nLLM-based agents (\u201CAI agents\u201D is sometimes \\nused in short),
        whose growing capabilities create \\nboth significant opportunities for adoption
        and a \\nnew set of challenges in governance and safety.\\nAI agents are shifting
        from prototypes to \\ndeployment, bringing both transformative \\nopportunities
        and novel governance challenges.\\nFIGURE 1 Foundations for the responsible

        5\\nLLM-based AI agents, for example, introduce new \\nrisks such as goal
        misalignment, behavioural drift, \\ntool misuse and emergent coordination
        failures \\nthat traditional software governance models are \\nunable to manage.
        Unlike conventional software, \\nagents are increasingly assuming roles that
        \\nresemble those of human decision-makers rather \\nthan static tools. This
        means that governance \\nmodels designed solely for access control and \\nsystem
        reliability are no longer sufficient. A more \\nuseful comparison is the governance
        applied \\nto human users, who must earn permissions, \\naccountability and
        trust by demonstrating\_performance\\nover time. Similarly, trust in AI agents
        can be \\nestablished by testing their behaviour against \\nvalidated cases,
        running them in human-in-the\\u0002loop configurations and gradually expanding
        \\nautonomy only once reliability has been sufficiently \\ndemonstrated. In
        both cases, the principle of least \\nprivilege remains essential, with access
        limited to \\ninformation and actions necessary for the task.\\nThis report
        aims to provide\_a\_forward-looking\_analysis \\nof the evolving landscape\_of\_AI\_agents,
        focusing \\non the capabilities, infrastructure,\_classification and \\nsafeguards
        necessary for responsible deployment.\\nTo\_this end, it is structured around
        four foundational \\npillars across classification, evaluation, risk assessment
        \\nand governance, which together form the foundation \\nfor a progressive
        approach to adoption and \\ndeployment. Figure 1 presents the general content
        \\nof this report, which helps guide the responsible \\nadoption and deployment
        of AI agents.\\nThe goal is to equip adopters, providers, technical \\nleaders,
        organizational decision-makers and other \\nstakeholders with a shared understanding
        of the \\ncurrent state of agentic systems and emerging \\noversight practices.

        Topics\\nGen AI\\nAI Governance\\nLow Code\\nAgentic AI\\nOrchestration\\nObservability\\nArtificial
        intelligence is entering a new phase defined not just by intelligence, but
        by**autonomy**. From marketing assistants that launch personalized campaigns
        to supply chain bots that reorder inventory on their own, the rise of*agentic
        AI*marks a turning point in how software operates. Yet as these systems gain
        more independence, the need for governance and guardrails becomes exponentially
        more critical.\\nAccording to*McKinsey*,[just 1%] of surveyed organizations
        believe that their AI adoption has reached full maturity. While many enterprises
        are experimenting with autonomous agents and generative models, few have established
        the safety, accountability, and alignment mechanisms required to deploy them
        responsibly at scale. The challenge isn\u2019t just about building smarter
        agents; it\u2019s about ensuring those agents act within**trusted, observable
        boundaries**.\\nThe*Institute for AI Policy and Strategy*\u2019s recent field
        guide highlights this emerging tension: as decision-making moves from algorithms
        to autonomous agents, governance must evolve from reactive oversight to[proactive
        orchestration]. In other words, it\u2019s no longer enough to manage data
        and models, organizations must now manage AI behavior.\\nAt Rierino, we\u2019ve
        seen this shift firsthand through enterprises scaling their generative and
        agentic AI initiatives from pilots to production. One insight stands out:
        the more powerful and connected AI agents become, the more essential**governed
        orchestration**is to balance autonomy with control.\\nThis article explores
        what effective AI agent governance looks like \u2014the risks it mitigates,
        the layers that make it work, and how**orchestration-first low-code**architecture
        enables trust, transparency, and security in the age of autonomous systems.\\n#
        Why Governance Matters More for Agentic AI\\nThe concept of**AI governance**isn\u2019t
        new \u2014most organizations already apply policies around data use, model
        validation, and compliance. But agentic AI changes the scope of what must
        be governed. Traditional systems make predictions or recommendations; agents
        go a step further by initiating and executing actions in live environments.
        That shift from decision to autonomous execution fundamentally transforms
        the governance challenge.\\n> > In classical AI, risk management focuses on
        **> how\\n**> a model behaves. With agentic systems, it\u2019s equally about
        **> what\\n**> the model can do \u2014and under what circumstances.\\n> Each
        agent\u2019s capacity to perceive, decide, and act introduces new layers of
        operational risk that data ethics frameworks or model fairness audits alone
        cannot address. This new paradigm requires oversight across three fronts:\\n*
        **Action Control:**ensuring agents can act only within predefined scopes and
        policies.\\n* **Inter-Agent Coordination:**managing how multiple agents interact
        or collaborate to prevent conflict or duplication.\\n* **Continuous Accountability:**maintaining
        full traceability over every decision, event, and action for audit and compliance.\\nAs
        enterprises move beyond proof-of-concept deployments into production-scale
        systems, the absence of such controls can quickly lead to unintended automation,
        data exposure, or decision drift, issues that traditional governance frameworks
        were never designed to detect in real time.\\nAgentic AI, in other words,
        doesn\u2019t just need smarter governance; it needs**dynamic, execution-aware**governance
        that can monitor, interpret, and intervene in the flow of autonomous operations
        as they unfold.\\n# Top Governance Challenges for Autonomous Agents\\nDespite
        growing interest in agentic AI, most enterprises still underestimate the complexity
        of governing autonomy. The very qualities that make agents valuable, independence,
        adaptability, and collaboration, also introduce new and often invisible risks.
        Below are five of the most critical governance challenges organizations face
        as they move from experimentation to large-scale deployment.\\n**1. Unbounded
        Autonomy:**Without defined boundaries, autonomous agents may take actions
        that exceed their intended authority or cascade across systems. For example,
        a logistics optimization agent might reroute shipments to improve efficiency
        but inadvertently disrupt existing service-level agreements or inventory priorities.
        This challenge arises when autonomy is granted without clearly codified limits.
        Agents may operate with good intent but without awareness of strategic, ethical,
        or operational constraints.\\n**2. Opaque Decision Flows:**As agents self-adapt
        or collaborate, their internal decision logic can become difficult to trace
        or explain. In practice, this means a business cannot easily determine why
        a specific action occurred, what data triggered it, or whether it aligned
        with compliance policies. When decision paths lack transparency, accountability
        mechanisms fail, leaving enterprises unable to reconstruct cause-and-effect
        relationships during audits or incident analysis.\\n**3. Runtime Drift:**Over
        time, agents may diverge from their initial parameters as they learn from
        evolving data and context. A recommendation agent, for instance, might start
        prioritizing outcomes that maximize short-term engagement over long-term customer
        value if its reward signals shift subtly. Governance frameworks must therefore
        include continuous validation and feedback loops to detect behavioral drift
        before it compounds into systemic bias or unintended automation.\\n**4. Coordination
        Conflicts:**When multiple agents operate within shared environments, their
        independent actions can overlap or contradict one another. A pricing agent
        might apply a discount while a revenue management agent simultaneously adjusts
        base prices, both rational individually but conflicting collectively. These
        conflicts reveal the need for orchestration and dependency management, ensuring
        that agents don\u2019t act in isolation but within an agreed-upon coordination
        protocol.\\n**5. Auditability and Accountability Gaps:**Traditional monitoring
        systems were not designed for real-time, autonomous decision chains. Without
        detailed logs of every decision and action, enterprises risk compliance blind
        spots, especially in regulated sectors like banking, telecom, or government.
        True accountability requires fine-grained observability: a continuous record
        of inputs, outputs, and actions that can be queried or rolled back at any
        point in time.\\n**6. Resource and Cost Inefficiency:**Unsupervised agents
        can also introduce hidden operational costs when allowed to execute actions
        or queries without optimization. Excessive API calls, non-strategic task repetition,
        or uncontrolled use of large language model tokens can quickly inflate spend
        without delivering proportional value. For instance, a content generation
        agent might consume thousands of unnecessary tokens refining an output that
        never reaches production. Effective governance must therefore extend to resource
        orchestration and budget control, ensuring that autonomy remains economically
        as well as operationally sustainable.\\nAgentic AI requires governance that
        extends beyond model oversight to execution-time control \u2014the ability
        to monitor, interpret, and intervene in agentic behavior as it unfolds. This
        shift sets the foundation for the next layer: designing effective,**multi-tiered
        governance frameworks**that balance autonomy with accountability.\\n# What
        Effective AI Agent Governance Looks Like\\nEffective governance for agentic
        AI isn\u2019t about limiting innovation, it\u2019s about shaping autonomy
        within safe, observable boundaries. As enterprises move from experimentation
        to scaled deployment, governance must evolve into a multi-layered system that
        defines rules, enforces them during execution, and ensures continuous accountability
        afterward.\\nAn emerging best practice is to view AI agent governance across
        three complementary layers: Policy, Platform, and Oversight. Each plays a
        distinct role in ensuring that autonomy remains productive, compliant, and
        aligned with human intent.\\n## 1. Policy Layer: Defining the Rules of Autonomy\\nThe
        foundation of any governance model is a clear, codified policy framework.
        This layer sets the**limits of autonomy**, outlining what an agent can do,
        under what conditions, and with what access rights. For example, in a government
        services environment, an AI intake agent may automatically classify and route
        citizen requests but must flag any case that involves sensitive personal data
        for manual verification.\\nThis layer acts as the blueprint for accountability.
        When implemented through[composable low-code architectures], these rules can
        be versioned, reused, and adapted across teams, ensuring consistent governance
        as agents evolve.\\n## 2. Platform Layer: Enforcing Guardrails at Runtime\\nEven
        the best policies mean little if they can\u2019t be enforced dynamically.
        The platform layer ensures that rules set at design time translate into**real-time
        control and observability**during execution. This is where orchestration becomes
        essential.\\nThrough centralized execution flows, enterprises can monitor
        agent actions as they happen, validate them against defined policies, and
        trigger fallback or escalation mechanisms when anomalies occur. As an example,
        in financial operations, an agent responsible for reconciling cross-border
        transactions may autonomously process low-value payments but must request
        human validation for high-value or cross-jurisdiction transfers.\\nThis\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/rierino/image/upload/f_auto/media/blog/media/hero/ai-agent-governance-trust-autonomy-hero.png\",\"favicon\":\"https://rierino.com/favicon.ico\"},{\"id\":\"https://www.aigl.blog/ai-agent-governance-a-field-guide-iaps-apr-2025/\",\"title\":\"AI

        \\n## **\u26A1 Quick Summary**\\nThis field guide from the Institute for AI
        Policy and Strategy maps the near-term reality of agentic AI\u2014LLM-scaffolded
        systems that plan, remember, use tools, and act\u2014and the governance work
        needed before they scale to \u201Cmillions or billions.\u201D It distinguishes
        hype from evidence: agents can already add value (customer support, AI R&amp;D,
        some cyber tasks) but underperform humans on long, open-ended workflows. The
        core governance question is how to keep autonomous, tool-using systems safe,
        steerable, and accountable at scale. The report\u2019s keystone is a five-category
        intervention taxonomy\u2014Alignment, Control, Visibility, Security &amp;
        robustness, and Societal integration\u2014spanning model, system, and ecosystem
        layers, with concrete mechanisms (e.g., shutdown/rollback, agent IDs, activity
        logging, liability regimes). The authors argue the capability curve (especially
        \u201Ctest-time compute\u201D models like o-series) will bend upward faster
        than governance capacity unless institutions, standards, and infrastructure
        are built now. (See the intervention table and scenarios on pp. 10\u201312
        and 34\u201347; agent architecture diagram on p.14.)\\n## \U0001F9E9What\u2019s
        Covered\\n* **Current state of agents.**A crisp definition (\u201CAI systems
        that can autonomously achieve goals in the world\u201D) and the scaffolding
        pattern around frontier models: reasoning/planning, memory, tool-use, and
        multi-agent collaboration (p.14\u201317). Benchmarks summarized across GAIA,
        METR Autonomy Evals, SWE-bench (incl. Verified), WebArena, OSWorld, RE-bench,
        CyBench, etc., showing sharp fall-offs as human task time exceeds \\\\~1 hour
        and on open, visually grounded, or long-horizon tasks (pp. 16\u201321; Appendix
        pp. 52\u201355).\\n* **Pathways to better agents.**Improvements via stronger
        \u201Ccontroller\u201D models and better scaffolding/orchestration; rise of**test-time
        compute**(o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1) enabling longer, higher-quality reasoning; memory/tool
        ecosystems; multi-agent orchestration (pp. 21\u201323).\\n* **Adoption lens.**Where
        early ROI lands: customer relations (Klarna case), AI/ML R&amp;&amp;D (engineering-heavy
        steps, fast feedback), and cybersecurity (mixed\u2014but promising\u2014signals).
        Adoption governed by performance, cost (often 1/30th of US bachelor median
        wage on certain tasks), and**reliability**(pp. 22\u201328).\\n* **Risk landscape.**Four
        buckets: (1)**Malicious use**(scaled disinformation, cyber offense, dual-use
        bio); (2)**Accidents &amp; loss of control**(from mundane reliability failures
        to \u201Crogue replication\u201D and scheming/deception); (3)**Security**(expanded
        attack surface from tools, memory, and agent-agent dynamics, incl. \u201Cinfectious
        jailbreaks\u201D); (4)**Systemic risks**(labor displacement, power concentration,
        democratic erosion, market \u201Chyperswitching\u201D) (pp. 27\u201333).\\n*
        **Agent governance as a distinct field.**Why agents change the governance
        calculus: direct world actions, opacity + speed, multi-agent effects, and
        new levers at the ecosystem layer (payments, browsers, IDs). Priorities include
        capability/risk monitoring, lifecycle controls, incentivizing defensive/beneficial
        use, adapting law/policy (pp. 31\u201335).\\n* **Intervention taxonomy (core
        contribution).**\\n* **Alignment**(e.g., multi-agent RL, risk-attitude alignment,
        CoT paraphrasing, alignment evals).\\n* **Control**(e.g., rollback infrastructure,
        shutdown/interrupt/timeouts, tool/action restrictions, control protocols &amp;&amp;
        evaluations).\\n* **Visibility**(e.g.,**Agent IDs**, activity logging, cooperation-relevant
        capability evals, RL**reward reports**).\\n* **Security &amp; robustness**(e.g.,
        access control tiers, adversarial robustness testing,**sandboxing**, rapid
        response for adaptive defense).\\n* **Societal integration**(e.g.,**liability
        regimes**, commitment devices/smart contracts, equitable agent access schemes,**law-following
        agents**).Each category includes plain-language vignettes showing how a measure
        works in practice (pp. 36\u201347).\\n* **Two futures.**\u201CAgent-Driven
        Renaissance\u201D vs. \u201CAgents Run Amok\u201D scenarios make the stakes
        concrete\u2014highlighting the need for IDs, logging, rollbacks, defensive
        agents, and access/benefit-sharing (pp. 10\u201313).\\n* **Research &amp;
        capacity gap.**Few teams are working on agent governance relative to the resources
        pouring into capability-building; the guide flags funders, workshops, and
        priority research threads (pp. 5\u20137, 31\u201335, 48\u201350).\\n(See the**taxonomy
        table**on p.6 and pp. 36\u201347 for detailed exemplars;**agent architecture
        diagram**on p.14;**benchmark summaries**on pp. 18\u201321 and Appendix.)\\n#
        **\U0001F4A1 Why it matters?**\\nAgents aren\u2019t just chatbots\u2014they\u2019re**actors**.
        Once systems can plan, remember, and click \u201Cbuy\u201D (orexec), classic
        safety levers (content filters, pre-deployment evals) aren\u2019t enough.
        Governance must move**into the loop**: IDs and logs for traceability; rollback/shutdown
        for damage control; sandboxing and access controls for containment; liability
        and law-following to align incentives; and alignment methods suited to long-horizon,
        multi-agent settings. Building this stack**before**mass deployment is the
        difference between autonomous productivity and autonomous externalities. The
        report delivers a concrete, actionable blueprint. (See pp. 34\u201347.)\\n#
        **\u2753 What\u2019s Missing**\\n* **Operational maturity levels.**A readiness/assurance
        model (e.g., Agent-ML levels with required controls/evals per tier) would
        help buyers and regulators phase adoption.\\n* **Quantified control efficacy.**The
        guide catalogs controls but offers limited empirical evidence on success rates
        (e.g., mean time-to-shutdown, rollback coverage, bypass rates).\\n* **Supply-chain
        specifics.**More detail on browser/OS, payment, and cloud co-regulation (who
        hosts agent IDs, where logs live, cross-jurisdiction handling).\\n* **Human
        factors.**Guidance for organizational design: who owns rollback authority,
        separation of duties, incident playbooks, and \u201Ckill-switch\u201D drills.\\n*
        **Evaluation economics.**Costs and sampling strategies to make agent evals
        reproducible at scale (the Appendix notes time/cost, but buyers need budgeting
        templates).## \U0001F465Best Fo**r**\\n* **CISOs/CIOs &amp; platform owners**designing

        accelerating development of agentic \\nartificial intelligence (AI) and the
        prospect of artificial \\ngeneral intelligence (AGI) create unprecedented
        \\nopportunities alongside complex governance challenges. \\nThis paper examines
        the ethical, regulatory, and technical \\ndimensions of governing highly autonomous
        AI systems, \\ndrawing upon more than fifty contemporary academic and \\npolicy
        sources. Three core insights emerge. First, current \\ngovernance structures
        provide limited coverage of risks \\nlinked to recursive self-improvement
        and multi-agent \\ncoordination, with only an estimated 10\u201315% of safety
        \\nresearch addressing impacts that arise after deployment. \\nSecond, economic
        projections suggest that agentic AI could \\ngenerate between 2.6 and 4.4
        trillion USD in added global \\noutput by 2030, yet automation could replace
        \\napproximately 28\u201342% of existing job tasks, making \\nproactive workforce
        transition strategies a policy necessity. \\nThird, fragmented regulatory
        approaches remain a concern; \\nin the United States, for example, 70\u201375%
        of critical \\ninfrastructure is considered vulnerable to adversarial \\nautonomous
        systems. To address these issues, we propose a \\ngovernance model built on
        three pillars: modular agent \\ndesign, adaptive safety mechanisms, and international
        \\ncoordination. Policy measures such as licensing thresholds \\nfor high-computer
        systems exceeding 10^25 FLOPs, \\nstructured red-team testing across public
        and private \\nsectors, and fiscal incentives for governance-by-design \\npractices
        are advanced as actionable pathways. Overall, the \\nstudy argues for adaptive,
        globally coordinated governance \\nframeworks that balance innovation with
        systemic risk \\nmitigation in the era of agentic AI and AGI. his is a pure
        \\nreview paper and all results, proposals and findings are from \\nthe cited
        literature. \\nKEYWORDS- AI Governance, Agentic AI, Generative \\nAI, Artificial

        Self-Improvement, Multi\\u0002Agent Systems, Workforce Transition, International
        \\nCoordination\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nThe emergence of agentic artificial intelligence
        (AI)\u2014\\nsystems capable of autonomous goal-setting, decision\\u0002making,
        and task execution\u2014marks a fundamental \\nparadigm shift in computational
        intelligence. Unlike \\nconventional generative AI, which operates within
        static \\nprompt\u2013response frameworks, agentic AI demonstrates \\ndynamic
        adaptability, recursive self-improvement (RSI), \\nand multi-agent collaboration
        [1], [2]. These capabilities \\nenable agentic systems not only to generate
        content but also \\nto plan, execute, and optimize tasks with minimal human
        \\noversight. Parallel advancements in artificial general \\nintelligence
        (AGI) further amplify both the transformative \\npotential and systemic risks
        of these technologies. Current \\neconomic projections suggest that agentic
        AI could \\ncontribute between $2.6 and $4.4 trillion to global GDP by \\n2030,
        while simultaneously automating 28\u201342% of job\\u0002related tasks [3],
        [4]. Such forecasts underscore the dual \\nchallenge of harnessing productivity
        gains while mitigating \\nwidespread labor market disruptions.\\nDespite growing
        awareness, existing governance \\nframeworks remain ill-equipped to manage
        the \\ncomplexities of agentic AI and AGI. This paper identifies \\nthree
        central gaps in current approaches. First, regulatory \\nand ethical models
        provide insufficient guidance for \\naddressing risks associated with recursive
        self\\u0002improvement and autonomous multi-agent coordination. \\nSecond,
        regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions \\nhinders coherent oversight;
        in the United States alone, \\nestimates indicate that 70\u201375% of critical
        infrastructure \\nremains exposed to adversarial exploitation by autonomous
        \\nsystems [5]. Third, policy tools remain largely static, \\nlacking the
        adaptive mechanisms necessary to keep pace \\nwith rapidly evolving agentic
        technologies.\\nTo address these issues, this paper synthesizes insights from
        \\nover fifty contemporary sources, including academic \\nliterature (32%),
        industry reports (28%), and government \\npublications (20%), with a particular
        emphasis on policy \\ndevelopments in 2024\u20132025, such as the European
        Union\u2019s \\nAI Act [6] and the United States\u2019 Executive Order 14110\\n[7].

        with data source references\\nsystems (>10^25 FLOPs), structured public\u2013private
        red\\u0002teaming protocols, and governance-by-design tax \\nincentives. The
        concluding section outlines urgent priorities \\nfor research and regulation,
        with the aim of developing \\nadaptive, globally coordinated governance frameworks
        that \\nbalance innovation with existential risk mitigation.\\nII. LITERATURE
        REVIEW\\nThe literature review presented in this study is based on a \\nsystematic
        synthesis of more than fifty sources, \\nencompassing academic journals, industry
        reports, \\ngovernment publications, conference proceedings, and \\ntrade
        media. The objective of this review is to capture the \\nevolving technical,
        ethical, and policy dimensions of \\nagentic artificial intelligence (AI)
        and artificial general \\nintelligence (AGI) governance across multiple \\nperspectives.\\nAcademic
        journals constituted the largest share of reviewed \\nmaterials, accounting
        for approximately 32% of the \\nsources. These works were primarily drawn
        from peer\\u0002reviewed venues such as IEEE Computer [8], specialized \\noutlets
        focusing on robotics, safety, and alignment [4], and \\nprominent policy journals.
        The emphasis of this body of \\nwork was on technical architecture (15%),
        governance \\nframeworks (10%), and quantitative risk analyses (7%), \\nproviding
        the theoretical and conceptual foundation for \\nsubsequent developments.\\nIndustry
        contributions represented 28% of the corpus, with \\ninfluential white papers
        from technology corporations such \\nas IBM [9] and Deloitte [10], alongside
        reports by global \\nthink tanks including the Global Skill Development Council
        \\n(GSDC) [5]. These reports concentrated on market \\nprojections (12%),
        deployment case studies (9%), and \\nemerging self-regulation standards (7%).
        Although industry \\nsources provided pragmatic insights into implementation,
        \\nthey also reflected a tendency toward optimism regarding \\nscalability
        and adoption.\\nGovernment publications accounted for 20% of the \\nreferences,
        with key contributions including analyses of the \\nU.S. Executive Orders
        on AI [7], the European Union\u2019s AI \\nAct [6], and the United Nations\u2019
        perspectives on AI \\ngovernance [11]. These materials collectively focused
        on \\nregulatory frameworks (14%) and national strategies (6%), \\noffering
        a policy-oriented complement to technical studies. \\nIn parallel, conference
        proceedings and preprints comprised \\n12% of the literature, particularly
        from NeurIPS workshops \\non AI safety and IEEE Symposia addressing AGI \\ngovernance.
        These emerging works provided insights into \\nalgorithmic innovations (8%)
        and governance prototypes \\n(4%), reflecting the experimental stage of research
        in this \\narea. Finally, 8% of the sources were derived from news \\noutlets
        and trade media such as TechRadar [12] and \\nMarkTechPost [13]. These contributions
        highlighted real\\u0002world deployments (5%) and expert interviews (3%),
        \\nserving as a bridge between academic analysis and public \\ndiscourse.\\nIn
        terms of temporal distribution, nearly half of the \\nreviewed works (50%)
        were published in 2025, reflecting \\nthe intensification of debates surrounding
        agentic AI \\ndeployment, risk analyses [18], and U.S.-specific \\nregulatory
        actions [19]. A further 32% were concentrated in \\n2024, coinciding with
        a surge in ethical frameworks [16] \\nand global policy proposals [11]. The
        earlier period of \\n2021\u20132023 accounted for 18% of the references, focusing
        \\nlargely on distinctions between generative and agentic AI \\n[14] and the
        first wave of governance frameworks [15].\\nGeographically, the review reflects
        both national and \\ninternational perspectives. U.S.-centric studies comprised
        \\n45% of the dataset, particularly in relation to federal and \\nstate-level

        AI Agent Governance\\n### A research agenda for policymakers and researchers\\n![]
        \\nJacob Pratt\\nSeptember 30, 2025\\n![$hero_image['alt']] \\n### Key Takeaways\\n*
        **How AI agents will impact society is still uncertain.**While the body of
        scholarly work and publicly available evidence are growing, we don\u2019t
        yet know enough about how AI agents will be used or what impacts they may
        have. However, AI investments continue to soar, so policymakers should begin
        to prepare now.\\n* **Policymakers should prioritize evidence and information
        gathering, including through sandboxes and testbeds.**Given this uncertainty,
        policymakers should promote activities to generate evidence, rather than advancing
        prescriptive regulations. Promising options policymakers can use to build
        expertise and track developments are sandboxes and testbeds, which enable
        experimentation of new systems under regulatory supervision.\\n* **Subsequent
        rule-making will require substantial research from inside and outside of government.**Academia,
        civil society, government, and industry should work together to generate evidence
        on AI agents&#8217; capabilities, risks, societal impacts, and potential policy
        interventions. This will support future policy development.\\n* **This paper
        provides a roadmap for this research.**We outline three foundational requirements
        for governing AI agents and detail a comprehensive research agenda, including
        12 top-level and 45 sub-level questions, designed to directly support policymakers
        in developing evidence-based policy.\\nIndustry leaders have named 2025 the
        \u201Cyear of agentic exploration,\u201D foretelling the adoption of systems
        that will change how we interact, what jobs we perform, and even how we think.
        However, these innovations face significant hurdles: widespread AI agent adoption
        has been stifled by persistent reliability and security challenges, giving
        policymakers an opportunity to prepare thoughtfully for how to promote the
        benefits and protect against the risks of AI agents.\\nMaking the right public
        policy decisions on AI governance, including on the institutions, policies,
        regulations, and tools that ensure that AI systems operate in the public interest,
        requires substantial research and evidence. Though there is significant research
        done on AI more broadly and the theoretical impacts of AI agents, we don\u2019t
        yet know enough about how AI agents will be used or what impacts they may
        have. The key challenge for policymakers is not whether to regulate now, but
        how to govern AI agents while their impacts are still uncertain, and understand
        what evidence will be needed to make informed decisions when decisive action
        is needed.\\n> The key challenge for policymakers is not whether to regulate
        now, but how to govern AI agents while their impacts are still uncertain.\\n**In
        this paper, we outline a research agenda to guide policymakers and researchers
        in preparing for the governance of AI agents.**Structured around three core
        technology governance requirements for policymakers &#8211; foundational understanding,
        impact assessment, and intervention evaluation &#8211; we present 12 top-level
        questions and 45 detailed open sub-questions from literature and partner discussions
        that policymakers and researchers should explore. We also explore how monitoring,
        sandboxes, and testbeds can be an important first step for policymakers.\\nPAI
        has already started conducting research that supports this agenda, and have
        recently published work on[prioritizing real-time failure detection] and[global
        governance]. We will continue to build on this work, and look forward to collaborating
        with our community to advance AI agent governance.\\nDownload the full research
        agenda and be a part of guiding evidence-based AI agent governance now.\\n[Back

        AI agents should be regulated by the extent to which they operate autonomously.
        AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant
        risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing
        regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm,
        we argue that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed
        by agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation.
        To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations
        from scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of
        using action sequences -- which reflect the degree of an agent&#39;s autonomy
        -- as a more suitable measure of potential impact than existing metrics that
        rely on observing environmental states. Comments:|Updated to improve the overall

        field of AI agent governance. Agents - AI systems that can autonomously achieve
        goals in the world, with little to no explicit human instruction about how
        to do so - are a major focus of leading tech companies, AI start-ups, and
        investors. If these development efforts are successful, some industry leaders
        claim we could soon see a world where millions or billions of agents autonomously
        perform complex tasks across society. Society is largely unprepared for this
        development. A future where capable agents are deployed en masse could see
        transformative benefits to society but also profound and novel risks. Currently,
        the exploration of agent governance questions and the development of associated
        interventions remain in their infancy. Only a few researchers, primarily in
        civil society organizations, public research institutes, and frontier AI companies,
        are actively working on these challenges. Subjects:|Computers and Society

        \\nImage generated by Bing## Executive Summary\\nThe discourse surrounding
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agentic systems in July 2025 is rife with both
        immense promise and considerable misunderstanding. A critical distinction
        has solidified: on one hand, there are sophisticated AI-powered tools that
        automate predefined workflows, often mislabeled as \u201Cagents\u201D; on
        the other, there are truly autonomous AI agents capable of independent decision-making
        and goal execution. While the former offers significant, achievable efficiency
        gains, the latter, though rapidly advancing, remains in a \u201Cresearch preview\u201D
        phase for high-stakes applications, necessitating a pragmatic approach to
        adoption.\\nLeading technology players like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta
        are actively deploying and integrating autonomous agent capabilities. These
        agents demonstrate impressive abilities, from automating complex web tasks
        and office chores to orchestrating multi-step personal projects and generating
        advertising content. However, their current limitations are clear: they struggle
        with sensitive, high-stakes tasks, complex interfaces, and certain web access
        restrictions, often requiring human oversight for critical actions.\\nEnterprise
        adoption is accelerating, with a substantial majority of executives already
        deploying or planning to deploy AI agents, driven by the perception of significant
        competitive advantage. This adoption often follows a pragmatic, risk-mitigated
        approach, starting with rule-based processes and incorporating robust human-in-the-loop
        oversight. The regulatory environment, particularly the EU AI Act, is shaping
        deployment strategies, emphasizing data governance, transparency, and accountability,
        which are critical for building trust. Despite the hype, confidence in fully
        autonomous agents has declined, highlighting a \u201Ctrust gap\u201D that
        organizations must address through ethical governance and explainability.\\nThe
        realistic return on investment (ROI) for AI agents extends beyond immediate
        cost reductions to encompass substantial gains in operational efficiency,
        productivity, enhanced customer experience, and accelerated innovation. While
        quantifying ROI can be complex, early adopters are reporting measurable value
        and a significant competitive edge. The path forward for AI Agentic involves
        a continued focus on addressing technical limitations, navigating ethical
        complexities, and fostering a collaborative human-AI operational model to
        unlock its full transformative potential, moving beyond aspirational \u201Cfull
        autonomy\u201D to achievable, impactful augmentation.\\n## 1. Demystifying
        AI Agentic: What Are True Autonomous Agents?\\nThe term \u201CAI Agentic\u201D
        has become a prevalent buzzword, often leading to confusion regarding the
        actual capabilities of various AI systems. As of July 2025, a clear definition
        has emerged, distinguishing between AI-powered tools that enhance existing
        processes and genuinely autonomous AI agents that operate with independent
        decision-making authority. Understanding this distinction is crucial for strategic
        planning and avoiding the \u201Cinnovation theatre\u201D that can fuel unrealistic
        expectations [30].\\n### 1.1 Defining AI Agents: From LLMs to Autonomous Decision-Making\\nThe
        fundamental concept of AI Agentic, as understood in July 2025, centers on*autonomous
        agents*. These are systems designed to receive a high-level goal and then
        independently execute multiple operations, including making choices and potentially
        initiating actions such as payments [30]. This capability represents a significant
        advancement beyond traditional AI tools. For instance, OpenAI describes its
        agents, including the newly integrated ChatGPT Agent (formerly Operator),
        as \u201CAIs capable of doing work for you independently \u2014you give it
        a task and it will execute it\u201D [1]. This directly aligns with the principle
        of autonomous execution.\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n![]
        \\nThe Agentic mode in ChatGPT\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) serve as foundational
        components, acting as the \u201Cbrains\u201D or \u201Creasoning engines\u201D
        that enable these autonomous solutions. However, it is important to recognize
        that LLMs themselves are not the agents. The evolution of AI has seen LLMs
        overcome their inherent limitations, such as poor calculation abilities or
        fixed training data, by gaining the capacity to interface with external tools.
        This includes calling a calculator for complex mathematical operations, retrieving
        information from external document collections via architectures like Retrieval-Augmented
        Generation (RAG), connecting to the internet, or interfacing with email and
        notification systems [30]. This integration of tools was a pivotal step towards
        agentic behavior.\\nThe transition from LLMs as standalone processing units
        to LLMs functioning as enablers within larger, orchestrated autonomous systems
        signifies a fundamental architectural evolution in AI. This shift moves the
        primary focus of innovation from merely scaling model size to designing sophisticated
        system architectures and enhancing reasoning capabilities. For businesses,
        this implies that successful AI agent adoption will require more than simply
        acquiring access to the latest LLM. It necessitates a strategic emphasis on
        integrating these models into robust, tool-augmented architectures and developing
        a deep understanding of the system-level design required for truly autonomous
        operation. The future gains in AI are increasingly expected to come from \u201Csmarter
        algorithms\u201D and architectural innovation, rather than solely from building
        bigger models [2].\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n![]
        \\nMulti agents interaction \u2014source[https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/]
        \\nThe rapid proliferation of the \u201CAI Agentic\u201D term, often misapplied
        to less autonomous systems, has created considerable market excitement and
        a sense of \u201Cfear of missing out\u201D (FOMO) among top management [30].
        This dynamic necessitates a clear, grounded definition for effective strategic
        decision-making. The competitive pressures in the AI market incentivize companies
        to rebrand existing automation or LLM-powered tools as \u201Cagents\u201D
        to capitalize on the hype. This marketing-driven terminology can obscure the
        true capabilities for non-technical executives. Consequently, a critical component
        of any organization\u2019s AI strategy must involve thorough due diligence
        and an internal understanding of the actual functionalities of any \u201Cagent\u201D
        solution. Without this clarity, organizations risk misallocating resources,
        setting unrealistic expectations, and experiencing disillusionment, which
        could undermine broader AI adoption efforts.\\n### 1.2 The Critical Distinction:
        Programmed Tools vs. Autonomous Agents\\nA clear demarcation exists between
        programmed AI tools and truly autonomous AI agents, a distinction articulated
        through a software versioning analogy in the initial discussion.\\n**Programmed
        Agents (Version 2.1.0): The Achievable Automation**\\nThese systems are fundamentally
        \u201CRPA on steroids or RPA powered by GenAI\u201D [30]. They integrate LLMs
        with other LLMs or broader IT systems but operate with \u201Czero freedom
        of decision\u201D [30]. Their execution is \u201Cguided and controlled,\u201D
        strictly following \u201Cpredetermined tracks\u201D [30]. Frameworks such
        as LangChain and LangGraph are instrumental in developing these more complex,
        multi-step workflows. Typical applications include automated document processing,
        email sorting, meeting summaries, and workflow management, where tasks are
        specific and circumscribed [4]. These solutions are \u201Cextraordinary and
        can truly help and improve many processes\u201D [30], delivering significant,
        measurable value within established operational frameworks.\\n**Autonomous
        Agents (Version 4.0.0): The Aspirational Frontier**\\nThese represent the
        genuine \u201CAgentic AI\u201D under discussion in 2025, characterized by
        true \u201Cdecision-making autonomy\u201D [30]. The user provides a high-level
        goal, such as \u201Cplan a weekend trip,\u201D and the agent independently
        performs all necessary operations, including navigating the internet, making
        choices, and potentially initiating payments [30]. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Agent,
        launched on July 17, 2025, is presented as a leading example of this paradigm
        shift.1 Other key players include Google DeepMind, with AlphaEvolve optimizing
        algorithms and Project Mariner automating web tasks, and Anthropic, which
        develops Claude agents for complex problem-solving [5].\\nThe versioning analogy
        used to illustrate this evolution is as follows from [30]:\\n* **Version 2.1.0:**Represents
        programmed agents, where individual LLMs are guided to perform specific, circumscribed
        tasks.\\n* **Version 3.0.0:**Marks the emergence of reasoning engines, such
        as OpenAI\u2019s o1 (launched September 2024), which natively integrate complex
        architectures to increasingly approximate human-like reasoning.\\n* **Version
        3.1.0:**Encompasses open-source advancements in reasoning, notably accelerated
        by projects like DeepSeek\u2019s R1.\\n* **Version 4.0.0:**Denotes truly autonomous
        agents that not only have access to tools but \u201Cautonomously choose which
        to use and which decisions to take\u201D .\\nThe evolution from programmed
        tools to autonomous agents signifies a fundamental shift from the automation
        of*steps*to the automation of*goals*. This fundamentally alters how businesses
        can approach process optimization and problem-solving. Programmed agents are

      PwC\u2019s AI Agent Survey\\nCopy linkLink copied to clipboard\\n![Example pattern
      for mobile] \\n![] \\n## Summary\\n* Companies are increasing AI investments
      and realizing productivity gains, but few are transforming how work gets done.\\n*
      The biggest barrier isn\u2019t the technology; it\u2019s mindset, change readiness
      and workforce engagement.\\n* Trust lags for high-stakes use cases, underscoring
      the need for responsible AI.\\n* Few businesses are connecting agents across
      workflows and functions, yet that\u2019s where the real value lies.\\n### Key
      trends about AI agents in the enterprise\\nAI agents aren\u2019t just the future
      \u2014they\u2019re already on the job. Today, they\u2019re delivering real results.
      US companies are ramping up investments, and many are already seeing returns.
      But despite the momentum, most haven\u2019t made the bold, strategic shifts
      needed to sustain that success.\\nOf the 300 senior executives in our May 2025
      survey, 88% say their team or business function plans to increase AI-related
      budgets in the next 12 months due to agentic AI. Seventy-nine percent say AI
      agents are already being adopted in their companies. And of those adopting AI
      agents, two-thirds (66%) say that they\u2019re delivering measurable value through
      increased productivity.\\nYet from what we\u2019re seeing in the field, broad
      adoption doesn\u2019t always mean deep impact. Many employees are using agentic
      features built into enterprise apps to speed up routine tasks \u2014surfacing
      insights, updating records, answering questions. It\u2019s a meaningful boost
      in productivity, but it stops short of transformation.\\n> > While embedded
      agents from hyperscalers and model providers are seeing strong uptake, the real
      opportunity is still ahead. Reports of full adoption often reflect excitement
      about what agentic capabilities could enable \u2014not evidence of widespread
      transformation.\\n> > That\u2019s beginning to shift. Multi-agent models are
      emerging as a powerful next step \u2014systems of AI agents working in concert
      to deliver tangible results. These agents can take on complex, cross-functional
      workflows across finance, customer service, software development, R&amp;D and
      more.\\nAI isn\u2019t just another technology, as more and more executives recognize.
      Three-quarters (75%) agree or strongly agree that AI agents will reshape the
      workplace more than the internet did. What\u2019s more, 71% agree that AI agents
      are advancing so quickly that artificial general intelligence (AGI), in which
      AI can think, learn and solve problems as broadly and flexibly as a human, will
      be a reality within two years.\\nWith the potential for disruption growing,
      playing it safe isn\u2019t a strategy. To lead with AI, you need to move with
      intention. Our survey reveals four areas that demand your attention.\\n## 1.
      Budgets are surging\\nAlmost nine out of 10 executives surveyed (88%) say their
      companies plan to up their AI-related budgets this year due to agentic AI. Over
      a quarter plan increases of 26% or more, likely to pay for ambitious plans.\\n>
      > Of those companies adopting AI agents, 35% say they\u2019re doing so broadly,
      while another 17% say AI agents are being fully adopted in almost all workflows
      and functions.\\n> > Still, most (68%) report that half or fewer of their employees
      interact with agents in their everyday work. Few have the kind of agentic workflows
      that a[leading hospitality company] we worked with has already put in place.
      There, employees and customers engage with teams of AI agents working across
      functions \u2014enhancing experiences, improving speed and driving down costs.\\nThis
      is a real-world example of multi-agent models in action \u2014AI agents working
      together to deliver meaningful outcomes. While this is already delivering significant
      value for one company, it signals what\u2019s next for many others.\\n## 2.
      Measurable value is here\\nIf your company is like most, leadership (and other
      stakeholders) want AI results now \u2014increased revenue, lower costs or other
      concrete value \u2014and AI agents are delivering. Of those adopting AI agents,
      nearly two-thirds (66%) report increased productivity. Over half (57%) report
      cost savings, faster decision-making (55%) or improved customer experience (54%).
      As with AI generally, early value often comes from internal use cases, but customer-facing
      cases are rising fast.\\n> > 73% of survey respondents agree that\\nSummary:

      The Rise of AI Agents: Redefining Automation and Productivity in 2025\\n* ![Picture
      of IntouchCX Team] IntouchCX Team\\n* April 8, 2025\\n![] \\nThe integration
      of AI into everyday business operations has reached a turning point. In 2024,
      AI models became smarter and more efficient; in 2025, the focus shifts from
      intelligence to action. AI agents are no longer just responsive tools\u2014they
      are autonomous systems capable of executing complex workflows, making strategic
      decisions, and seamlessly integrating into business operations to enhance productivity
      and efficiency across industries, reshaping the way businesses operate and setting
      new standards for automation and collaboration.\\nFrom Chatbots to Fully Autonomous
      AI Agents\\nThe transition from conversational AI to AI agents is a game-changer.
      While traditional AI models like chatbots primarily generate text and answer
      questions, AI agents go further by taking independent actions based on contextual
      understanding. These agents can schedule meetings, manage workflows, analyze
      large datasets, and even navigate the web to perform complex tasks without human
      intervention.\\n[**The future of AI isn&#8217;t just smarter chatbots\u2014it&#8217;s
      fully autonomous AI agents that anticipate needs, execute tasks, and continuously
      learn from interactions.**] This shift is transforming the way businesses operate,
      integrating AI agents into daily workflows and leveraging advancements in AI
      orchestration, where multiple agents collaborate in enterprise settings. Instead
      of relying on a single AI model, businesses will deploy specialized AI agents
      fine-tuned for different roles\u2014whether handling customer service inquiries,
      managing supply chains, or optimizing marketing campaigns.\\n**The Business
      Impact of AI Agents**\\nThe adoption of AI agents will transform industries
      by boosting efficiency and scalability. Companies deploying these autonomous
      systems expect significant productivity gains, with early estimates suggesting
      up to a 30% increase in operational efficiency.\\n**Key benefits include:**\\n*
      **Task Automation:**AI agents will handle repetitive and time-consuming processes,
      allowing employees to focus on strategic initiatives.\\n* **Scalability:**Businesses
      can expand operations without proportionally increasing costs, as AI agents
      streamline workflows.\\n* **Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities:**Beyond text-based
      interactions, AI agents will process images, audio, and video to provide richer
      insights and solutions.\\n* **AI-Powered Decision-Making:**These agents will
      leverage real-time data analysis to make informed recommendations, reducing
      the need for human oversight in routine decision-making.\\nThe Emergence of
      Multi-Agent Systems\\nAs businesses scale AI adoption, they will transition
      from using single AI agents to deploying coordinated teams of specialized agents.
      These AI-powered &#8220;swarms&#8221; will work in tandem, breaking down complex
      workflows into manageable steps.\\nFor example, an enterprise AI ecosystem might
      consist of:\\n* A scheduling agent that coordinates meetings based on team availability.\\n*
      A customer support agent that resolves inquiries in real time.\\n* A research
      agent that scans market trends and generates reports.\\nThis interconnected
      approach enhances efficiency while ensuring that AI-driven processes remain
      dynamic and adaptable to real-world business needs.\\nAI Agents and Human Oversight\\nDespite
      their autonomy, AI agents will not operate in isolation. Human oversight remains
      crucial for handling high-stakes decisions, ethical considerations, and complex
      problem-solving. The challenge for businesses in 2025 will be striking the right
      balance between automation and human intervention, ensuring that AI-driven processes
      remain accountable and aligned with organizational goals.\\nThe Future of AI
      Agents in Enterprise Workflows\\nLooking ahead, AI agents have the potential
      to become an integral part of the workforce. As regulations catch up with rapid
      technological advancements, businesses must navigate new frameworks for AI governance,
      data security, and ethical AI deployment.\\nWith AI orchestration tools streamlining
      operations and new protocols enabling seamless integration with third-party
      technologies, AI agents will redefine what\u2019s possible in automation. From
      handling routine administrative tasks to driving strategic decision-making,
      these digital co-workers are set to revolutionize productivity, efficiency,
      and innovation across industries.\\nHowever, AI cannot operate in isolation\u2014human
      involvement remains essential to ensure accuracy, ethical decision-making, and
      empathetic customer interactions. By automating repetitive processes, AI frees
      up agents to focus on complex problem-solving and emotionally intelligent engagements,
      enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\nAI agents are not just
      the next step in automation\u2014they are the future of work. Find out how you

      AI agents in 2025: Expectations vs. reality\\nIt\u2019s impossible to take two
      steps across the tech media landscape without stumbling over an article hailing
      2025 as the year of the[AI agent]. Agents, we\u2019re told, will transform the
      way work is done, impacting every facet of our lives, personal and professional.\\nWe\u2019d
      barely surfaced from a landslide of NFT and crypto hype that characterized the
      early 2020s, and the metaverse bubble that followed, before media voices began
      singing the praises of[generative AI] (gen AI) in the wake of releases such
      as OpenAI\u2019s[GPT] model family, Anthropic\u2019s[Claude] and Microsoft\u2019s
      Copilot.\\nWhile the chorus hasn\u2019t moved on entirely, the focus in 2025
      has shifted from[large language models (LLMs)] to advancements in the ostensibly
      autonomous[artificial intelligence (AI)] agents ushering in the future of work.\\nDespite
      a momentary surge in gen AI interest around[Deepseek] \u2019s R1, which promised
      significant performance improvements over ChatGPT, the dominant innovation narrative
      in 2025 is the AI agent.\\nMedia coverage highlights the promises of innovation,[automation]
      and efficiency agents will bring, but how much of the conversation is click-hungry
      hype?\\nThe ad-supported media world thrives on clicks, and it\u2019s reasonable
      to expect sensational, attention-grabbing headlines crafted to garner yours.
      But what can we realistically expect from[agentic AI] in 2025, and how will
      it affect our lives?\\nWe spoke with several IBM experts to cut through the
      hype, with the goal of holding a more reasonable conversation about AI agents
      and what they\u2019re going to do. Our team of informed insiders includes:\\n*

      What are AI agents?\\nAn AI agent is a software program capable of acting autonomously
      to understand, plan and execute tasks. AI agents are powered by LLMs and can
      interface with tools, other models and other aspects of a system or network
      as needed to fulfill user goals.\\nWe\u2019re going beyond asking a chatbot
      to suggest a dinner recipe based on the available ingredients in the fridge.
      Agents are more than automated[customer experience] emails that inform you it\u2019ll
      be a few days until a real-world human can get to your inquiry.\\n[AI agents
      differ from traditional AI assistants] that need a prompt each time they generate
      a response. In theory, a user gives an agent a high-level task, and the agent
      figures out how to complete it.\\nCurrent offerings are still in the early stages
      of approaching this idea. \u201CWhat\u2019s commonly referred to as \u2018agents\u2019
      in the market is the addition of rudimentary planning and tool-calling (sometimes
      called function calling) capabilities to LLMs,\u201D says Ashoori. \u201CThese
      enable the LLM to break down complex tasks into smaller steps that the LLM can
      perform.\u201D\\nHay is optimistic that more robust agents are on the way: \u201CYou
      wouldn\u2019t need any further progression in models today to build[future AI
      agents],\u201D he says.\\nWith that out of the way, what\u2019s the conversation
      about agents over the coming year, and how much of it can we take seriously?\\nAI
      agents\\n### What are AI agents?\\nFrom monolithic models to compound AI systems,
      discover how AI agents integrate with databases and external tools to enhance
      problem-solving capabilities and adaptability.\\n[\\nLearn more\\n] \\n## Narrative
      1: 2025 is the year of the AI agent\\n\u201CMore and better agents\u201D are
      on the way, predicts Time.[1] \u201CAutonomous \u2018agents\u2019 and profitability
      are likely to dominate the artificial intelligence agenda,\u201D reports Reuters.[2]
      \u201CThe age of agentic AI has arrived,\u201D promises Forbes, in response
      to a claim from Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang.[3] \\nTech media is awash with assurances
      that our lives are on the verge of a total transformation. Autonomous agents
      are poised to streamline and alter our jobs, drive optimization and accompany
      us in our daily lives, handling our mundanities in real time and freeing us
      up for creative pursuits and other higher-level tasks.\\n### 2025 as the year
      of agentic exploration\\n\u201CIBM and Morning Consult did a survey of 1,000
      developers who are building AI applications for enterprise, and 99% of them
      said they are exploring or developing AI agents,\u201D\_explains Ashoori. \u201CSo
      yes, the answer is that 2025 is going to be the year of the agent.\u201D However,
      that declaration is not without nuance.\\nAfter establishing the current market
      conception of agents as LLMs with function calling, Ashoori draws a distinction
      between that idea and truly autonomous agents. \u201CThe true definition [of
      an AI agent] is an intelligent entity with reasoning and planning capabilities
      that can autonomously take action. Those reasoning and planning capabilities
      are up for discussion. It depends on how you define that.\u201D\\n\u201CI definitely
      see AI agents heading in this direction, but we\u2019re not fully there yet,\u201D
      says Gajjar. \u201CRight now, we\u2019re seeing early glimpses\u2014AI agents
      can already analyze data, predict trends and automate workflows to some extent.
      But building AI agents that can autonomously handle complex decision-making
      will take more than just better algorithms. We\u2019ll need big leaps in contextual
      reasoning and testing for edge cases,\u201D she adds.\\nDanilevsky isn\u2019t
      convinced that this is anything new. \u201CI&#39;m still struggling to truly
      believe that this is all that different from just orchestration,\u201D she says.
      \u201CYou&#39;ve renamed orchestration, but now it&#39;s called agents, because
      that&#39;s the cool word. But orchestration is something that we&#39;ve been
      doing in programming forever.\u201D\\nWith regard to 2025 being the year of
      the agent, Danilevsky is skeptical. \u201CIt depends on what you say an agent
      is, what you think an agent is going to accomplish and what kind of value you
      think it will bring,\u201D she says. \u201CIt&#39;s quite a statement to make
      when we haven&#39;t even yet figured out ROI (return on investment) on LLM technology
      more generally.\u201D\\nAnd it\u2019s not just the business side that has her
      hedging her bets. \u201CThere&#39;s the hype of imagining if this thing could
      think for you and make all these decisions and take actions on your computer.
      Realistically, that&#39;s terrifying.\u201D\\nDanilevsky frames the disconnect
      as one of miscommunication. \u201C[Agents] tend to be very ineffective because
      humans are very bad communicators. We still can&#39;t get chat agents to interpret
      what you want correctly all the time.\u201D\\nStill, the forthcoming year holds
      a lot of promise as an era of experimentation. \u201CI&#39;m a big believer
      in [2025 as the year of the agent],\u201D says Hay excitedly.\\nEvery large
      tech company and hundreds of startups are now experimenting with agents. Salesforce,
      for example, has released their Agentforce platform, which enables users to
      create agents that are easily integrated within the Salesforce app ecosystem.\\n\u201CThe
      wave is coming and we&#39;re going to have a lot of agents. It&#39;s still a
      very nascent ecosystem, so I think a lot of people are going to build agents,
      and they&#39;re going to have a lot of fun.\u201D\\n## Narrative 2: Agents can
      handle highly complex tasks on their own\\nThis narrative assumes that today\u2019s
      agents meet the theoretical definition outlined in the introduction to this
      piece. 2025\u2019s agents will be fully autonomous AI programs that can scope
      out a project and complete it with all the necessary tools they need and with
      no help from human partners. But what\u2019s missing from this narrative is
      nuance.\\n### Today\u2019s models are more than enough\\nHay believes that the
      groundwork has already been laid for such developments. \u201CThe big thing
      about agents is that they have the ability to plan,\u201D he outlines. \u201CThey
      have the ability to reason, to use tools and perform tasks, and they need to
      do it at speed and scale.\u201D\\nHe cites 4 developments that, compared to
      the best models of 12 to 18 months ago, mean that the models of early 2025 can
      power the agents envisioned by the proponents of this narrative:\\n* Better,
      faster, smaller models\\n* Chain-of-thought (COT) training\\n* Increased context
      windows\\n* Function calling\\n\u201CNow, most of these things are in play,\u201D
      Hay continues. \u201CYou can have the AI call tools. It can plan. It can reason
      and come back with good answers. It can use inference-time compute. You\u2019ll
      have better chains of thought and more memory to work with. It&#39;s going to
      run fast. It\u2019s going to be cheap. That leads you to a structure where I
      think you can have agents. The models are improving and they&#39;re getting
      better, so that&#39;s only going to accelerate.\u201D\\n### Realistic expectations
      are a must\\nAshoori is careful to differentiate between what agents will be
      able to do later, and what they can do now. \u201CThere is the promise, and
      there is what the agent&#39;s capable of doing today,\u201D she says. \u201CI
      would say the answer depends on the use case. For simple use cases, the agents
      are capable of [choosing the correct tool], but for more sophisticated use cases,
      the technology\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: Top Tried and Tested Use Cases

      Radulescu] Andreea Radulescu\\n![graphic-of-hashtag-true-story-about-ai-agent-use-cases]
      \\nImagine your calendar reminding you of a meeting, then booking the room,
      sending the brief, gathering the right people, and following up afterward with
      action items. Ok, your calendar cannot do all of that; that\u2019s what an autonomous
      AI agent brings to the table. It doesn\u2019t just notify you. It thinks, acts,
      and makes things happen in the background so you don\u2019t have to.\\nThese
      aren\u2019t glorified chatbots. They\u2019re your new smart digital coworkers,
      always on, never confused, and constantly improving with every task they complete.
      Whether it\u2019s streamlining finance, simplifying HR, supporting students,
      or managing supply chains, AI agents are already embedded in the workflows that
      matter.\\nLet\u2019s explore the real-world use cases showing why these agents

      proactive team members who get things done.\\nAnd the ROI? It\u2019s compelling.
      Studies point to 30\u201380% improvements in speed, accuracy, and cost savings
      across industries when deploying agentic AI workflows. Let's dig into what these
      agents are actually doing in the real world.\\n## Most In-Demand Use Cases for
      Autonomous AI Agents in 2025\\nAs more organizations shift from static automation
      to intelligent systems that adapt, decide, and execute, autonomous AI agents
      are stepping into roles once handled by multiple tools, and sometimes, entire
      teams. These agents aren\u2019t just supporting workflows; they\u2019re running
      them from start to finish. What was once limited to isolated tasks is now evolving
      into coordinated, cross-functional processes.\\nBelow are the most in-demand,
      high-impact use cases, showcasing where autonomous AI agents deliveredreal business
      value in 2025.\\n### Finance &amp; Accounting Automation\\n* Accounts Payable

      Agents: Analyze stock levels, demand trends, and lead times to trigger replenishments
      and reduce holding.## The Real Value of Smart Digital Coworkers\\nWhile many
      businesses start exploring[autonomous AI agents for efficiency], the real payoff
      goes far beyond shaving minutes off a task. When implemented with orchestration,
      secure integrations, and lifecycle visibility, these agents transform how work
      gets done, and who does it.\\nHere\u2019s what they really bring to the table:\\n###
      Always-On Productivity with Autonomous AI Agents\\nOne of the most immediate
      benefits of autonomous AI agents is their 24/7 availability. Unlike human teams,
      they don\u2019t sleep, get overloaded, or miss an email. These smart digital
      coworkers keep processes moving around the clock, whether it\u2019s answering
      internal HR questions at 2 AM or processing invoices over the weekend. This
      uninterrupted productivity reduces lag, accelerates workflows, and allows your
      teams to stay focused on higher-value work.\\n### Contextual Decision-Making
      Using Gen AI and Agentic Execution\\nSmart automation isn\u2019t about doing
      things faster, it\u2019s about doing them better.[Autonomous AI agents equipped
      with generative AI] can understand the nuance behind a request, while agentic
      workflows give them the power to act on that insight. This combination allows
      agents to make decisions based on user history, policy data, and workflow context,
      resulting in responses and actions that are not just accurate, but relevant
      and timely.\\n### End-to-End Automation Through Integrated AI Agent Workflows\\nModern
      enterprises don\u2019t need point solutions, they need systems that can handle
      tasks from start to finish. AI agents shine in end-to-end automation, managing
      everything from initiation to validation, updates, and closure. Whether it\u2019s
      onboarding a new employee, processing a refund, or handling a service request,
      these agents coordinate actions across systems to ensure no task is dropped
      mid-stream.\\n### Real ROI with Scalable, Low-Overhead AI Agents\\nIt\u2019s
      not just about speed or intelligence. It\u2019s about impact. Autonomous AI
      agents offer a clear return on investment by reducing reliance on manual labor,
      minimizing errors, and increasing process consistency. With fewer tools needed
      to complete a workflow, less strain on human teams, and faster time-to-value,
      these agents prove their worth quickly. And because they\u2019re modular, they
      scale with your business, without spiraling complexity or cost.\\n### Smarter
      Over Time: Learning and Adapting as They Work\\nThe value of smart digital coworkers
      compounds over time. These agents don\u2019t just perform, they learn. With
      every task, they gather more data, improve accuracy, and adapt to new business
      logic or user behavior. As your business evolves, your agents evolve with it,
      offering a level of continuity and improvement that static workflows simply
      can\u2019t match.\\n## Complete Industry Use-Case List for Autonomous AI Agents\\n###

      AI agents enhance campaign planning in 2025\\nMarketing teams face unprecedented
      complexity as campaigns span multiple channels, require real-time optimization,
      and demand[personalized experiences] at scale. Traditional automation tools
      execute predefined tasks but lack the intelligence to adapt strategies when
      market conditions shift or customer behaviors change unexpectedly.\\nA new generation
      of AI technology promises to transform how organizations plan campaigns and
      collaborate with clients. These autonomous systems analyze vast amounts of data,
      make strategic decisions, and execute[complex workflows] without constant human
      oversight \u2014fundamentally changing the relationship between marketers and
      their technology stack.\\nThe shift from reactive automation to proactive intelligence
      represents more than incremental improvement. The global AI agent market was
      estimated at[$5.40 billion] in 2024 and is forecast to reach $50.31 billion
      by 2030, representing explosive growth driven by expanding enterprise adoption.
      Organizations deploying these advanced AI capabilities report efficiency gains
      of 30-50%, dramatic reductions in campaign optimization cycles, and enhanced
      client satisfaction through real-time transparency and strategic insights.\\nAutonomous
      AI agents are intelligent systems designed to work independently, performing
      tasks such as campaign planning and client collaboration without constant human
      oversight. They leverage machine learning to adapt and execute complex strategies,
      enhancing efficiency and creativity in marketing initiatives. These agents integrate
      with external tools, retrieve relevant information, and adapt to dynamic environments
      through sophisticated reasoning architectures. Companies implementing marketing
      automation, including autonomous agent components, achieve average returns of
      $5.44 for every $1 invested, translating to[544%] return on investment over
      three years.\\n## What are autonomous AI agents?\\nAutonomous AI agents are
      intelligent systems designed to work independently, performing tasks such as

      AI every day reported that[33.5%] saved four hours or more per week, compared
      with only 11.5% of those using it only one day per week, showing a direct correlation
      between AI usage intensity and productivity gains.\\nUnlike traditional marketing
      automation that follows rigid &quot;if-then&quot; logic, autonomous agents process
      multiple signals simultaneously and adjust their approach based on context.
      They observe their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve
      specific marketing objectives \u2014whether that means optimizing ad spend,\\nSummary:

      of an autonomous AI agent symbolizing the advancements and potential of AI agents
      in 2025.] ## Introduction\\nAccording to recent research, the global autonomous
      AI agents market is projected to reach[$9.9 billion in 2025] and is anticipated
      to grow significantly to[$253.3 billion by 2034], registering a strong CAGR
      of43.4%during the forecast period. This explosive growth is driven by rapid
      enterprise adoption, continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, and
      the expansion of automation across diverse industries. North America is expected
      to command the largest market share in 2025, holding about 40.7% of the global
      market.\\nThis comprehensive guide explores autonomous AI agents&#8217; fundamentals,
      applications, and 2025 developments, providing essential insights for businesses,
      developers, and decision-makers navigating AI transformation.\\n## What Are
      Autonomous AI Agents? Understanding the Fundamentals\\nAutonomous AI agents
      are self-governing systems that operate independently without constant human
      intervention, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals
      using machine learning and environmental awareness.\\n[Autonomous AI agents]
      represent a significant leap forward from traditional AI systems. Unlike conventional
      artificial intelligence that requires explicit programming for every scenario,
      autonomous agents possess the capability to learn, adapt, and make independent
      decisions based on their environment and objectives. These systems combine[machine
      learning], natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to create
      intelligent entities that can operate with minimal human oversight.\\n**For
      example:**Learners today can[learn French with Langua&#8217;s AI platform],
      which uses these same principles to personalize instruction, track progress,
      and respond dynamically to the user\u2019s input mirroring how autonomous agents
      behave in complex business environments.\\nThe key distinction lies in their
      autonomy \u2013the ability to perceive their environment, process information,
      make decisions, and execute actions without waiting for human commands. This
      independence makes them particularly valuable for businesses seeking to automate
      complex processes, improve operational efficiency, and provide consistent service
      delivery around the clock.\\n#####\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: Agentic AI\u2019s

      than three-quarters of executives say most of their AI investment has focused
      on improving existing processes rather than developing net-new capabilities.\\n*
      Yet, 78% of C-Suiteexecutives say achieving maximum benefit from agentic AI
      requires a new operating model.\\n* Companies that excel in three key AI adoption
      areas are 32 times more likely to achieve top-tier business performance than
      those with minimal implementation.\\n### Rethinking how work works with agentic
      AI\\nAs companies continue to explore how to perform better with artificial
      intelligence, a cohort of executives are asking a question that goes far beyond
      simple deployment: \\\"What if we rebuild our entire operating model around
      AI?\\\"\\nA growing number already are\u2014and they're creating business outcomes
      that were previously impossible.\\nThese leaders aren't just implementing AI
      tools\u2014they're pioneering entirely new operating models around autonomous
      decision-making. The radical premise: that agentic AI systems will make an increasing
      number of decisions, while humans make the decisions that matter most, preserving
      human agency and expertise where it is most crucial.\\nThe performance gap is
      widening rapidly. These transformation-driven organizations are creating net-new
      business capabilities, fundamentally changing what's possible at enterprise
      scale.\\n|||||\\n|By||By||\\n|2027||2030||\\n|twice as many executives expect
      AI agents will make autonomous decisions in processes and workflows compared
      to today.||fully autonomous robotic systems with embodied AI will be operational
      realities across industries.||\\n|||||\\nThe companies winning in the autonomous
      AI future won't be those that simply deploy the most sophisticated AI agents.
      They'll be the organizations that abandon existing operating models for entirely
      new ones designed around autonomous decision-making capabilities.\\nIn the emerging
      AI transition, speed matters, but not all efforts are equal. Some organizations
      are reaching truly strategic peaks while others chase tactical AI.\\nTo better
      understand the real-world impact of autonomous AI, the IBM Institute for Business
      Value (IBM IBV) surveyed 800 C-suite executives in 20 countries across 19 industries.
      This report reveals key elements of an autonomous AI operating model \u2013from
      management mindset to workforce evolution to the role of trust and transparency.
      Alongside, we highlight changing team structures, and examples of specific operating
      model transformations in progress.\\nWe finish with an action guide that synthesizes
      what to do now to build a synergistic operating model that can optimize agentic
      AI\u2019s competitive benefits.\\n**Measurable impact: AI is expected to drive
      double-digit improvements across the enterprise**\\n![A chart showing results
      from IBM\u2019s own AI journey in business operations, as well as forecasted
      metrics from non-IBM executives by 2027.] \\n**Perspective**\\nAgentic AI\u2019s
      split screen\\nIn this recent survey of C-suite operational executives, we uncovered
      a fascinating divergence in how companies are approaching agentic AI. We asked
      two very telling questions, which revealed a sharp divide in strategic focus.\\nFirst,
      we asked what percentage of their agentic AI initiatives were focused on improving
      existing processes and how successful they were.\\nSecond, we asked what percentage
      of their agentic AI initiatives were designed to create entirely new workflow
      capabilities and how successful they were.\\nThe responses divided our respondents
      into two distinct groups.\\n**The process-focused**\\nThis group is technically
      getting it done; they're laser-focused on optimizing existing workflows and
      are achieving measurable business impact. In short, they are proficient at efficiency,
      but they have yet to crack the code on true transformation.\\n**The transformation-driven**\\nThis
      more strategic cohort is advancing agentic AI with a dual mandate. They are
      not only improving existing workflows, but they are also successfully creating
      and building net-new capabilities. Their vision extends beyond optimization;
      they are actively reimagining their operating model. The data shows it's working.
      They are achieving real-world value of AI and automation across their business
      operations.\\n### AI transformation isn\u2019t a forecast, it\u2019s a deadline\\nToday,
      24% of executives say that AI agents take independent action in their organization.
      By 2027, 67% expect that to be the case. Similarly, twice as many executives
      expect autonomous decision-making from agentic AI in processes and workflows
      by 2027 (57%) compared to today (28%). Even in highly regulated areas, transformation-driven
      organizations are moving fast \u2014executives expect agentic AI to automate
      an average of 29% of risk and compliance operations by 2027.And many anticipate
      that AI agents will automate the innovation process itself, with 19% of executives
      saying that is happening today and 48% of executives expecting this level of
      innovation-related automation in 2027.\\nThese benchmarks represent a fundamental
      change in the DNA of business. It\u2019s no wonder that:\\n> 78% of our respondents
      agree that achieving maximum benefit from agentic AI requires a new operating
      model.\\nAmid global economic uncertainty, 69% of them report a pressing need
      to develop more agentic AI-enabled predictive and simulation modeling capabilities\u2014for
      example, for financial forecasting, human resource talent and skilling analysis,
      dynamic transportation and distribution routing and scheduling, and proactive
      mitigation strategies with built-in resilience.\\nCustomer-touching operations
      have emerged as primary arenas for agentic AI implementation. Organizations
      are prioritizing sales forecasting, dynamic pricing based on inventory scenarios,
      and intelligent customer order processing\u2014areas where autonomous system
      intelligence can deliver immediate competitive advantages and measurable returns.\\nThe
      appetite for change is real, but a critical chasm exists between aspiration
      and execution. The vast majority of AI investment\u201478%, has been funneled
      into improving existing processes. This is the difference between optimization
      and transformation. Process-focused organizations are stuck in a loop of making
      their current operations better, rather than making transformative leaps a reality.\\n####
      How decision-makers think differently about agentic AI\\nThe organizations achieving
      genuine transformation are those that view agentic AI not as a tool to do existing
      work faster but as a catalyst to do entirely new work efficiently. Consider
      the compliance challenge: in highly regulated industries, agentic AI isn\u2019t
      just flagging risks \u2014it\u2019s using teams of specialized agents to continuously
      scan, interpret, and act on regulatory changes across multiple jurisdictions
      and industries. Imagine one set of agents monitoring shifting financial rules
      in Europe, another tracking evolving trade sanctions in Asia, and yet another
      adjusting healthcare compliance workflows in the U.S. All of them work in concert,
      automatically updating communications, documentation, and approval processes
      in real time. The result? Risks can be mitigated before they materialize, compliance
      teams spend less time on repetitive reviews, and organizations can operate more
      confidently across geographies without drowning in legal complexity.\\n> Because
      they are focused on developing net-new capabilities, transformative organizations
      are asking different questions: What becomes possible when systems can make
      decisions autonomously?\\nAs well as: How do we redesign our value creation
      processes around this capability? These enterprises must also recognize the
      shifting landscape AI commoditization is driving. In other words, the window
      for first-mover advantages in process innovations is narrowing. Therefore, while
      investing in current operations isn't to be underestimated, the true key to
      competitive differentiation now lies in bold, transformative leaps forward.\\nThe
      measurement gap reveals this strategic divide clearly. Only 42% of the process-oriented
      organizations identified in our analysis have developed new key performance
      indicators (KPIs) to monitor AI agents' impact on business targets, compared
      to nearly half of transformational organizations (see Action Guide for examples
      of new KPIs). These leaders aren't just implementing agentic AI automation\u2014they're
      measuring different outcomes entirely.\\n> \u201CWhen you don\u2019t have good,
      objective KPIs, older ones take over. We see that technology is often deployed
      around creating improvements with the infrastructure you currently have.\u201D&nbsp;\\n**>

      AI: A new era in workplace productivity\\nTONOMUS Global Center for Digital
      and AI Transformation\\nBy Jialu Shan and[Michael R. Wade] \\n**September 2025\\nIn
      December 2023, we launched our first \u201C*Gen AI for Better Productivity*\u201D
      framework with 12 categories. At the time, the conversation was dominated by
      familiar use cases: chatbots that could handle customer queries, tools that
      could generate content at scale, image generation, and systems capable of accelerating
      code development. Soon after, we added new categories for transcription, translation
      and localization, capabilities that quickly proved their utility in everyday
      workflows. We have continued to update the framework with new tools.\\nFor this
      update, we\u2019re adding a pivotal new category:**Agentic AI**. This addition
      signals that business and technology leaders now see autonomous AI agents as
      a distinct productivity paradigm: a transformative shift in how we think about
      AI in the workplace.\\nBefore turning to this new frontier, it\u2019s worth
      pausing to look at the AI applications that have already proven their value.
      These tools have moved well beyond novelty and are now woven into daily workflows.\\n![
      - IMD Business School] \\n#### Continuity in core capabilities\\nAI has changed
      how we work, and the tools we use are here to stay. What began as experiments
      are now indispensable parts of our routines.\\n###### **Generative content creation:**\\nAI
      tools that create and edit text, images, presentations, and videos have become
      a huge part of our work lives. A[Microsoft survey] found 75% of global knowledge
      workers already use generative AI at work. Most users say AI saves them time
      (90%), helps them focus on more important tasks (85%), and makes them more creative
      (84%). We&#8217;ve come a long way from worrying that AI would stifle our creativity.
      In fact, a[2024 marketing report] found that 15% of marketing teams &#8220;couldn&#8217;t
      live without AI&#8221; because it made everyday tasks like creating presentations
      and transcribing audio so much faster and smoother.\\n###### **Knowledge work
      and communication:**\\nAI is also transforming how we handle information and
      communication. Companies now use advanced chatbots for customer service and
      internal helpdesks, dramatically improving response times. AI-powered research
      assistants can sift through documents and summarize key findings in seconds,
      tasks that once took humans hours of painstaking work. The impact on software
      development has been equally transformative. A study by[MIT Sloan, Microsoft
      Research, and GitHub] found that generative AI coding tools can reduce programming
      time by 56%, allowing developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving rather
      than routine implementation.\\n###### **Task automation:**\\nDaily tasks like
      managing email and scheduling meetings are now so much easier thanks to AI.
      Modern email assistants can sort your inbox and draft responses, and AI schedulers
      can find optimal meeting times without endless back-and-forth among participants.
      These tools have begun to seriously alleviate our digital overload. A[McKinsey
      report] estimated work automation with GenAI and other technologies could boost
      productivity growth 0.5 to 3.4% annually.\\nThe foundational uses of AI for
      productivity have proven resilient and enduring. However, the competitive landscape
      continues to evolve rapidly, with some companies rebranding (you\u2019ll notice
      the fresh logos in our graph) or pivoting their focus as the market matures.
      Take Tome: once a specialized presentation tool, it has shifted toward building
      enterprise solutions, reflecting shifting market dynamics and heightened competition
      in an increasingly crowded field.\\n#### **The new frontier: Agentic AI**\\nIf
      generative AI is about extending human capability, Agentic AI is about autonomous
      execution. Agentic AI refers to systems that can delegate, act, and learn on
      their own to accomplish a goal. Instead of waiting for precise, step-by-step
      prompts, an AI agent can take a high-level request like, \u201COrganize a one-day
      offsite for my team next month,\u201D and then navigate multiple tasks and tools
      to fulfil it. Agentic AI tools today can check calendars, research options,
      book venues, schedule travel, and draft agenda.\\n[Over a quarter of business
      leaders] say their organizations are already exploring agentic AI to a significant
      degree. The vision is for these agents to process different types of data (text,
      images, voice), coordinate with other AI services, and learn from experience
      to reliably execute complex tasks. Emerging platforms show the breadth of possibilities:**Manus**is
      a general AI agent that bridges thoughts into actions, designed to independently
      carry out complex real-world tasks without direct or continuous human guidance.
      Similarly,**Beam**focuses on simplifying data workflows and**Sana**&#8216;s
      AI agents are revolutionizing enterprise search and knowledge management.**Stack
      AI**allows teams to stitch together modular agents that orchestrate multiple
      AI services and traditional software tools.**Devin**positions itself as an \u201CAI
      software engineer\u201D that can independently write, test, and ship code. While
      not included in the agentic category, agentic modes of the frontier models,
      like**ChatGPT**and**Claude**are also starting to make waves.\\nThis doesn\u2019t
      mean companies are relinquishing full control. Early trials often keep a human
      &#8220;in the loop&#8221; to supervise. But the momentum is undeniable. Tech
      strategists now talk about an &#8220;AI workforce&#8221;: a concept that emphasizes
      augmentation, not replacement: AI agents as teammates rather than substitutes.
      For forward-looking firms, this means new opportunities to streamline operations,
      from an AI agent that triages IT support tickets overnight to one that summarizes
      market intelligence for a strategy team.\\n#### **The bigger picture**\\nAI
      has quickly moved from a novelty to a necessity in workplaces worldwide. The[same
      Microsoft survey] mentioned earlier found that 79% of business leaders say their
      company must adopt AI to stay competitive. This represents a generational consensus
      that AI has transitioned from &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; to &#8220;must-have&#8221;
      status.\\nThe goal across all these domains is not simply to do more work. It&#8217;s
      to free up our time and mental energy for what truly matters: the strategic,
      creative, and interpersonal aspects of work and life that AI cannot as easily
      replace. In just one year, AI&#8217;s role in productivity has grown from a
      set of practical tools to a broader ecosystem that includes emerging &#8220;colleague&#8221;
      agents. Yet, the mission remains consistent: to reduce friction and enable people
      to focus on what they do best.\\nThe AI landscape will undoubtedly keep evolving,
      but the lesson is already clear: the toolbox is expanding, and those who adopt
      thoughtfully will move not just with the tide, but ahead of it.\\nShare\\n![Share]

      Abstract\\n\\nThis qualitative content analysis examines how organizations can
      strategically integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous agents to
      enhance operational efficiency, ensure legal and ethical compliance, and foster
      workforce adaptability. Drawing on recent industry reports (e.g., Fujitsu, 2025;
      McKinsey & Company, 2024), academic studies (e.g., Giorgetti et al., 2025),
      and regulatory frameworks (e.g., NIST, 2023), we document significant operational
      gains attributable to AI-including cycle-time reductions of 30-85%, error-rate
      drops to below 1%, and anomalydetection accuracy reaching up to 99%. Despite
      these compelling efficiency improvements, persistent challenges hinder widespread
      and responsible adoption. These include critical governance gaps under evolving
      regulations like GDPR and CCPA, the pervasive risks of automation bias, the
      potential for workforce deskilling hazards, and inherent technical barriers
      such as the explainability of \\\"black-box\\\" AI models and the significant
      environmental impact related to AI's carbon footprint. To address these multifaceted
      challenges, this paper proposes a practical Four-Stage Adoption Framework and
      a detailed Five-Step Action Plan specifically designed for practitioners. The
      findings underscore the necessity of achieving a delicate balance between pursuing
      operational efficiency gains and ensuring the sustainability and inclusivity
      of AI integration efforts within organizations.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Artificial

      all companies invest in AI, but just 1 percent believe they are at maturity.

      are ready&mdash;but leaders, who are not steering fast enough.\\n### ![] \\n#####
      Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI\u2019s full potential\\n[(47
      pages)] \\n**Artificial intelligence has arrived in the workplace**and has the
      potential to be as transformative as the steam engine was to the 19th-century
      Industrial Revolution.1\u201C[Gen AI: A cognitive industrial revolution],\u201D
      McKinsey, June 7, 2024.With powerful and capable large language models (LLMs)
      developed by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we
      have entered a new information technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term
      AI opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added productivity growth potential from
      corporate use cases.2\u201C[The economic potential of generative AI: The next
      productivity frontier],\u201D McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\\nTherein lies the challenge:
      the long-term potential of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear.
      Over the next three years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI
      investments. But while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent
      of leaders call their companies \u201Cmature\u201D on the deployment spectrum,
      meaning that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business
      outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and steer
      their organizations closer to AI maturity.\\nThis research report, prompted
      by Reid Hoffman\u2019s book*Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our
      AI Future*,3Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato,*Superagency: What Could Possibly Go
      Right with Our AI Future*, Authors Equity, January 2025.asks a similar question:
      How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock new levels of
      creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive enormous positive
      and disruptive change. This transformation will take some time, but leaders
      must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly today to avoid becoming
      uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic and technological shifts
      shows that such moments can define the rise and fall of companies. Over 40 years
      ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies including Alphabet, Amazon,
      Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar market capitalizations.
      Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy of work and access to
      information. AI now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business
      leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small.\\n![] \\nThis report
      explores companies\u2019 technology and business readiness for AI adoption (see
      sidebar \u201CAbout the survey\u201D). It concludes that employees are ready
      for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership.\\n## About the survey\\n**To
      create our report,**we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors)
      and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent
      came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia,
      India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned
      many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management,
      sales, and technology.\\nAll the survey findings discussed in the report, aside
      from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces.
      The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees
      and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the
      US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences
      between US responses and those from other regions.\\n**Chapter 1**looks at the
      rapid advancement of technology over the past two years and its implications
      for business adoption of AI.\\n**Chapter 2**delves into the attitudes and perceptions
      of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for
      AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular
      basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will
      replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI
      skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large
      minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support.
      This is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in
      managerial roles, can be strong advocates for change.\\n![Agents, Robots, and
      Us] \\n### Agents, Robots, and Us: What executives need to know about AI and
      work\\n**Thursday, February 26, 10:30 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. ET / 4:30 p.m. - 5:00
      p.m. CET**\\nJoin McKinsey senior partners Alexis Krivkovich and Anu Madgavkar
      for a discussion of how executives can build effective human-AI skill partnerships,
      prepare their workforces, and make strategic decisions that position their organizations
      for growth in the age of AI.\\n[Register here] \\n**Chapter 3**looks at the
      need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want
      to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry
      about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater
      confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI
      right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and
      responsible decisions.\\n**Chapter 4**examines how companies risk losing ground
      in the AI race if leaders do not set bold goals. As the hype around AI subsides,
      companies should put a heightened focus on practical applications that empower
      employees in their daily jobs. These applications can create competitive moats
      and generate measurable ROI. Across industries, functions, and geographies,
      companies that invest strategically can go beyond using AI to drive incremental
      value and instead create transformative change.\\n**Chapter 5**looks at what
      is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge
      of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge
      that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their
      companies for change.\\nChapter 1\\n## An innovation as powerful as the steam
      engine\\nImagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but
      also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans
      in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency
      that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar \u201CAI superagency\u201D).
      This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact
      poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing
      press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by
      automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software
      can adapt, plan, guide\u2014and even make\u2014decisions. That\u2019s why AI
      can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually
      every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with
      one another.\\n> Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones
      in the cathedral of human progress.\\n> > Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn
      and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author\\nMany breakthrough
      technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have
      transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because
      it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage
      in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people
      acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds
      the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will
      be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits
      everyone.\\n## AI superagency\\n**What impact will AI have on humanity?**Reid
      Hoffman and Greg Beato\u2019s book*Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right
      with Our AI Future*(Authors Equity, January 2025) explores this question. The
      book highlights how AI could enhance human agency and heighten our potential.
      It envisions a human-led, future-forward approach to AI.\\nSuperagency, a term
      coined by Hoffman, describes a state where individuals, empowered by AI, supercharge
      their creativity, productivity, and positive impact. Even those not directly
      engaging with AI can benefit from its broader effects on knowledge, efficiency,
      and innovation.\\nAI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools,
      including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our
      world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize
      access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy
      it safely and equitably.\\nOver the past two years, AI has advanced in leaps
      and bounds, and enterprise-level adoption has accelerated due to lower costs
      and greater access to capabilities. Many notable AI innovations have emerged
      (Exhibit 1). For example, we have seen a rapid expansion of context windows,
      or the short-term memory of LLMs. The larger a[context window], the more information
      an LLM can process at once. To illustrate, Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 could process
      one million tokens in February 2024, while its Gemini 1.5 Pro could process
      two million tokens by June of that same year.4*The Keyword*,\_\u201COur next-generation

      recent years, organizations have moved beyond \\npredictive models and chat
      interfaces to experiment \\nwith artificial intelligence (AI) in more transformative
      \\nways. AI agents are now emerging as integrated \\ncollaborators in business,
      public services and \\neveryday life. The adoption of AI agents could \\nbring
      significant gains in efficiency, altered kinds of \\nhuman-machine interaction
      and the advent of novel \\ndigital ecosystems.\\nThis transition faces multiple
      obstacles that need to be \\naddressed. Moving from models to agents represents
      \\nmore than a technical milestone and requires \\norganizations to rethink
      how they design, evaluate and \\ngovern advanced agentic systems. Many companies
      \\nare now questioning what agents can accomplish \\nalongside the practical
      steps needed to adopt and \\ndeploy them safely, responsibly and effectively.\\nThis
      paper was developed to help answer those \\nquestions. By mapping the evolving
      foundations \\nof agentic systems, classifying their roles, \\nidentifying new
      ways to evaluate them and outlining \\nprogressive governance approaches, the
      paper \\noffers practical guidance for leaders navigating \\nadoption in real-world
      contexts.\\nThrough the AI Governance Alliance, the World \\nEconomic Forum
      and Capgemini are advancing \\nthis subject in collaboration with the AI community,
      \\nsignalling that now is the time to prepare for an \\nagentic future. If adopters
      start small, iterate \\ncarefully and apply proportionate safeguards, \\nagents
      can be deployed in ways that amplify \\nhuman capabilities, unlock productivity
      and \\nestablish a foundation for more complex multi-agent \\necosystems to
      emerge over time. Unless a careful \\nand deliberate approach to adoption is
      adopted, \\nuntested use cases could outpace oversight and \\nlead to misaligned
      incentives, emergent risks and \\nloss of public trust.\\nAs with any transformative
      technology, the \\nopportunities presented by AI agents must be \\naccompanied
      by a responsibility to guide their \\ndevelopment and deployment with care.
      Through \\ncross-functional efforts and collaborative \\ngovernance, AI agents
      can be integrated in ways \\nthat amplify human ingenuity, promote innovation
      \\nand improve overall quality of life. This paper is a \\nstep in that direction,
      offering guidance to help early \\nadopters navigate the complex and often uneven
      \\npath of AI agent adoption. \\nRoshan Gya\\nChief Executive Officer, \\nCapgemini

      mainly for adopters \\nof AI agents, including decision-makers, technical \\nleaders
      and practitioners seeking to integrate AI \\nagents into organizational workflows
      and services. \\nWhile AI agents are gaining traction, there remains \\nlimited
      guidance on how to design, test and \\noversee them responsibly. This paper
      aims to help \\nfill that gap by providing a structured foundation for \\nthe
      safe and effective deployment of these systems.\\nThe paper makes three key
      contributions. Firstly, \\nit covers the technical foundations of AI agents,
      \\nincluding their architectures, protocols and security \\nconsiderations.
      Secondly, it offers a functional \\nclassification that differentiates agents
      by their role, \\nautonomy, authority, predictability and operational \\ncontext.
      Thirdly, it suggests a progressive governance \\napproach that directly connects
      evaluation and \\nsafeguards to an agent\u2019s task scope and \\ndeployment
      environment.\\nTogether, these elements guide adopters\_with a \\nconceptual
      blueprint for moving from experimentation\\nto deployment. The report highlights
      the importance \\nof aligning adoption with evaluation and governance \\npractices
      to ensure that AI agents are successfully \\ndeployed while trust, safety and
      accountability \\nare maintained.\\nThis paper explores the emergence of AI
      \\nagents, outlining their technical foundations, \\nclassification, evaluation
      and governance to \\nsupport safe and effective adoption. \\nAI Agents in Action:
      Foundations for Evaluation and Governance 4\\nIntroduction\\nAI agents are gradually
      becoming embedded in \\nan increasing number of tasks, workflows and \\nuse
      cases that span cloud and edge computing, \\nleading the way to more widespread
      adoption. \\nAs the transition from prototyping to deployment \\naccelerates,
      current adoption remains concentrated \\namong early adopters. According to
      a recent global \\nsurvey of executives, 82% of organizations plan to \\nintegrate
      agents within the next one to three years, \\nindicating that most efforts are
      still in the planning or \\npilot phase,1\\n while moving towards wider adoption.\\nThe
      concept of software agents has been studied \\nfor decades in fields such as
      robotics, autonomous \\nsystems and distributed computing. What is different\\ntoday
      is the rise of data-driven models, particularly \\ngenerative artificial intelligence
      (AI) and large language\\nmodels (LLMs), which are enabling the emergence \\nof
      a new generation of LLM-based agents. These \\nsystems can generate plans, simulate
      reasoning \\nand adapt their behaviour through feedback \\nmechanisms in ways
      that were previously not \\npossible. This evolution has sparked a new \\nwave
      of experimentation, with researchers and \\ncompanies rapidly creating prototypes
      of agents \\nin various fields. This report focuses mainly on \\nLLM-based agents
      (\u201CAI agents\u201D is sometimes \\nused in short), whose growing capabilities
      create \\nboth significant opportunities for adoption and a \\nnew set of challenges
      in governance and safety.\\nAI agents are shifting from prototypes to \\ndeployment,
      bringing both transformative \\nopportunities and novel governance challenges.\\nFIGURE

      5\\nLLM-based AI agents, for example, introduce new \\nrisks such as goal misalignment,
      behavioural drift, \\ntool misuse and emergent coordination failures \\nthat
      traditional software governance models are \\nunable to manage. Unlike conventional
      software, \\nagents are increasingly assuming roles that \\nresemble those of
      human decision-makers rather \\nthan static tools. This means that governance
      \\nmodels designed solely for access control and \\nsystem reliability are no
      longer sufficient. A more \\nuseful comparison is the governance applied \\nto
      human users, who must earn permissions, \\naccountability and trust by demonstrating\_performance\\nover
      time. Similarly, trust in AI agents can be \\nestablished by testing their behaviour
      against \\nvalidated cases, running them in human-in-the\\u0002loop configurations
      and gradually expanding \\nautonomy only once reliability has been sufficiently
      \\ndemonstrated. In both cases, the principle of least \\nprivilege remains
      essential, with access limited to \\ninformation and actions necessary for the
      task.\\nThis report aims to provide\_a\_forward-looking\_analysis \\nof the
      evolving landscape\_of\_AI\_agents, focusing \\non the capabilities, infrastructure,\_classification
      and \\nsafeguards necessary for responsible deployment.\\nTo\_this end, it is
      structured around four foundational \\npillars across classification, evaluation,
      risk assessment \\nand governance, which together form the foundation \\nfor
      a progressive approach to adoption and \\ndeployment. Figure 1 presents the
      general content \\nof this report, which helps guide the responsible \\nadoption
      and deployment of AI agents.\\nThe goal is to equip adopters, providers, technical
      \\nleaders, organizational decision-makers and other \\nstakeholders with a
      shared understanding of the \\ncurrent state of agentic systems and emerging
      \\noversight practices. Building on established \\nAI governance principles

      paper \\nintroduces additional principles addressing \\nautonomy, authority,
      operational context and \\nsystemic risk that extend existing governance \\nguidance
      from an agent-focused lens. The \\ninsights have been informed by working group

      Topics\\nGen AI\\nAI Governance\\nLow Code\\nAgentic AI\\nOrchestration\\nObservability\\nArtificial
      intelligence is entering a new phase defined not just by intelligence, but by**autonomy**.
      From marketing assistants that launch personalized campaigns to supply chain
      bots that reorder inventory on their own, the rise of*agentic AI*marks a turning
      point in how software operates. Yet as these systems gain more independence,
      the need for governance and guardrails becomes exponentially more critical.\\nAccording
      to*McKinsey*,[just 1%] of surveyed organizations believe that their AI adoption
      has reached full maturity. While many enterprises are experimenting with autonomous
      agents and generative models, few have established the safety, accountability,
      and alignment mechanisms required to deploy them responsibly at scale. The challenge
      isn\u2019t just about building smarter agents; it\u2019s about ensuring those
      agents act within**trusted, observable boundaries**.\\nThe*Institute for AI
      Policy and Strategy*\u2019s recent field guide highlights this emerging tension:
      as decision-making moves from algorithms to autonomous agents, governance must
      evolve from reactive oversight to[proactive orchestration]. In other words,
      it\u2019s no longer enough to manage data and models, organizations must now
      manage AI behavior.\\nAt Rierino, we\u2019ve seen this shift firsthand through
      enterprises scaling their generative and agentic AI initiatives from pilots
      to production. One insight stands out: the more powerful and connected AI agents
      become, the more essential**governed orchestration**is to balance autonomy with
      control.\\nThis article explores what effective AI agent governance looks like
      \u2014the risks it mitigates, the layers that make it work, and how**orchestration-first
      low-code**architecture enables trust, transparency, and security in the age
      of autonomous systems.\\n# Why Governance Matters More for Agentic AI\\nThe
      concept of**AI governance**isn\u2019t new \u2014most organizations already apply
      policies around data use, model validation, and compliance. But agentic AI changes
      the scope of what must be governed. Traditional systems make predictions or
      recommendations; agents go a step further by initiating and executing actions
      in live environments. That shift from decision to autonomous execution fundamentally
      transforms the governance challenge.\\n> > In classical AI, risk management
      focuses on **> how\\n**> a model behaves. With agentic systems, it\u2019s equally
      about **> what\\n**> the model can do \u2014and under what circumstances.\\n>
      Each agent\u2019s capacity to perceive, decide, and act introduces new layers
      of operational risk that data ethics frameworks or model fairness audits alone
      cannot address. This new paradigm requires oversight across three fronts:\\n*
      **Action Control:**ensuring agents can act only within predefined scopes and
      policies.\\n* **Inter-Agent Coordination:**managing how multiple agents interact
      or collaborate to prevent conflict or duplication.\\n* **Continuous Accountability:**maintaining
      full traceability over every decision, event, and action for audit and compliance.\\nAs
      enterprises move beyond proof-of-concept deployments into production-scale systems,
      the absence of such controls can quickly lead to unintended automation, data
      exposure, or decision drift, issues that traditional governance frameworks were
      never designed to detect in real time.\\nAgentic AI, in other words, doesn\u2019t
      just need smarter governance; it needs**dynamic, execution-aware**governance
      that can monitor, interpret, and intervene in the flow of autonomous operations
      as they unfold.\\n# Top Governance Challenges for Autonomous Agents\\nDespite
      growing interest in agentic AI, most enterprises still underestimate the complexity
      of governing autonomy. The very qualities that make agents valuable, independence,
      adaptability, and collaboration, also introduce new and often invisible risks.
      Below are five of the most critical governance challenges organizations face
      as they move from experimentation to large-scale deployment.\\n**1. Unbounded
      Autonomy:**Without defined boundaries, autonomous agents may take actions that
      exceed their intended authority or cascade across systems. For example, a logistics
      optimization agent might reroute shipments to improve efficiency but inadvertently
      disrupt existing service-level agreements or inventory priorities. This challenge
      arises when autonomy is granted without clearly codified limits. Agents may
      operate with good intent but without awareness of strategic, ethical, or operational
      constraints.\\n**2. Opaque Decision Flows:**As agents self-adapt or collaborate,
      their internal decision logic can become difficult to trace or explain. In practice,
      this means a business cannot easily determine why a specific action occurred,
      what data triggered it, or whether it aligned with compliance policies. When
      decision paths lack transparency, accountability mechanisms fail, leaving enterprises
      unable to reconstruct cause-and-effect relationships during audits or incident
      analysis.\\n**3. Runtime Drift:**Over time, agents may diverge from their initial
      parameters as they learn from evolving data and context. A recommendation agent,
      for instance, might start prioritizing outcomes that maximize short-term engagement
      over long-term customer value if its reward signals shift subtly. Governance
      frameworks must therefore include continuous validation and feedback loops to
      detect behavioral drift before it compounds into systemic bias or unintended
      automation.\\n**4. Coordination Conflicts:**When multiple agents operate within
      shared environments, their independent actions can overlap or contradict one
      another. A pricing agent might apply a discount while a revenue management agent
      simultaneously adjusts base prices, both rational individually but conflicting
      collectively. These conflicts reveal the need for orchestration and dependency
      management, ensuring that agents don\u2019t act in isolation but within an agreed-upon
      coordination protocol.\\n**5. Auditability and Accountability Gaps:**Traditional
      monitoring systems were not designed for real-time, autonomous decision chains.
      Without detailed logs of every decision and action, enterprises risk compliance
      blind spots, especially in regulated sectors like banking, telecom, or government.
      True accountability requires fine-grained observability: a continuous record
      of inputs, outputs, and actions that can be queried or rolled back at any point
      in time.\\n**6. Resource and Cost Inefficiency:**Unsupervised agents can also
      introduce hidden operational costs when allowed to execute actions or queries
      without optimization. Excessive API calls, non-strategic task repetition, or
      uncontrolled use of large language model tokens can quickly inflate spend without
      delivering proportional value. For instance, a content generation agent might
      consume thousands of unnecessary tokens refining an output that never reaches
      production. Effective governance must therefore extend to resource orchestration
      and budget control, ensuring that autonomy remains economically as well as operationally
      sustainable.\\nAgentic AI requires governance that extends beyond model oversight
      to execution-time control \u2014the ability to monitor, interpret, and intervene
      in agentic behavior as it unfolds. This shift sets the foundation for the next
      layer: designing effective,**multi-tiered governance frameworks**that balance
      autonomy with accountability.\\n# What Effective AI Agent Governance Looks Like\\nEffective
      governance for agentic AI isn\u2019t about limiting innovation, it\u2019s about
      shaping autonomy within safe, observable boundaries. As enterprises move from
      experimentation to scaled deployment, governance must evolve into a multi-layered
      system that defines rules, enforces them during execution, and ensures continuous
      accountability afterward.\\nAn emerging best practice is to view AI agent governance
      across three complementary layers: Policy, Platform, and Oversight. Each plays
      a distinct role in ensuring that autonomy remains productive, compliant, and
      aligned with human intent.\\n## 1. Policy Layer: Defining the Rules of Autonomy\\nThe
      foundation of any governance model is a clear, codified policy framework. This
      layer sets the**limits of autonomy**, outlining what an agent can do, under
      what conditions, and with what access rights. For example, in a government services
      environment, an AI intake agent may automatically classify and route citizen
      requests but must flag any case that involves sensitive personal data for manual
      verification.\\nThis layer acts as the blueprint for accountability. When implemented
      through[composable low-code architectures], these rules can be versioned, reused,
      and adapted across teams, ensuring consistent governance as agents evolve.\\n##
      2. Platform Layer: Enforcing Guardrails at Runtime\\nEven the best policies
      mean little if they can\u2019t be enforced dynamically. The platform layer ensures
      that rules set at design time translate into**real-time control and observability**during
      execution. This is where orchestration becomes essential.\\nThrough centralized
      execution flows, enterprises can monitor agent actions as they happen, validate
      them against defined policies, and trigger fallback or escalation mechanisms
      when anomalies occur. As an example, in financial operations, an agent responsible
      for reconciling cross-border transactions may autonomously process low-value
      payments but must request human validation for high-value or cross-jurisdiction
      transfers.\\nThis\\nSummary: None\\n\\n\\nTitle: AI Agent Governance: A Field

      field guide from the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy maps the near-term
      reality of agentic AI\u2014LLM-scaffolded systems that plan, remember, use tools,
      and act\u2014and the governance work needed before they scale to \u201Cmillions
      or billions.\u201D It distinguishes hype from evidence: agents can already add
      value (customer support, AI R&amp;D, some cyber tasks) but underperform humans
      on long, open-ended workflows. The core governance question is how to keep autonomous,
      tool-using systems safe, steerable, and accountable at scale. The report\u2019s
      keystone is a five-category intervention taxonomy\u2014Alignment, Control, Visibility,
      Security &amp; robustness, and Societal integration\u2014spanning model, system,
      and ecosystem layers, with concrete mechanisms (e.g., shutdown/rollback, agent
      IDs, activity logging, liability regimes). The authors argue the capability
      curve (especially \u201Ctest-time compute\u201D models like o-series) will bend
      upward faster than governance capacity unless institutions, standards, and infrastructure
      are built now. (See the intervention table and scenarios on pp. 10\u201312 and
      34\u201347; agent architecture diagram on p.14.)\\n## \U0001F9E9What\u2019s
      Covered\\n* **Current state of agents.**A crisp definition (\u201CAI systems
      that can autonomously achieve goals in the world\u201D) and the scaffolding
      pattern around frontier models: reasoning/planning, memory, tool-use, and multi-agent
      collaboration (p.14\u201317). Benchmarks summarized across GAIA, METR Autonomy
      Evals, SWE-bench (incl. Verified), WebArena, OSWorld, RE-bench, CyBench, etc.,
      showing sharp fall-offs as human task time exceeds \\\\~1 hour and on open,
      visually grounded, or long-horizon tasks (pp. 16\u201321; Appendix pp. 52\u201355).\\n*
      **Pathways to better agents.**Improvements via stronger \u201Ccontroller\u201D
      models and better scaffolding/orchestration; rise of**test-time compute**(o1/o3,
      DeepSeek-R1) enabling longer, higher-quality reasoning; memory/tool ecosystems;
      multi-agent orchestration (pp. 21\u201323).\\n* **Adoption lens.**Where early
      ROI lands: customer relations (Klarna case), AI/ML R&amp;&amp;D (engineering-heavy
      steps, fast feedback), and cybersecurity (mixed\u2014but promising\u2014signals).
      Adoption governed by performance, cost (often 1/30th of US bachelor median wage
      on certain tasks), and**reliability**(pp. 22\u201328).\\n* **Risk landscape.**Four
      buckets: (1)**Malicious use**(scaled disinformation, cyber offense, dual-use
      bio); (2)**Accidents &amp; loss of control**(from mundane reliability failures
      to \u201Crogue replication\u201D and scheming/deception); (3)**Security**(expanded
      attack surface from tools, memory, and agent-agent dynamics, incl. \u201Cinfectious
      jailbreaks\u201D); (4)**Systemic risks**(labor displacement, power concentration,
      democratic erosion, market \u201Chyperswitching\u201D) (pp. 27\u201333).\\n*
      **Agent governance as a distinct field.**Why agents change the governance calculus:
      direct world actions, opacity + speed, multi-agent effects, and new levers at
      the ecosystem layer (payments, browsers, IDs). Priorities include capability/risk
      monitoring, lifecycle controls, incentivizing defensive/beneficial use, adapting
      law/policy (pp. 31\u201335).\\n* **Intervention taxonomy (core contribution).**\\n*
      **Alignment**(e.g., multi-agent RL, risk-attitude alignment, CoT paraphrasing,
      alignment evals).\\n* **Control**(e.g., rollback infrastructure, shutdown/interrupt/timeouts,
      tool/action restrictions, control protocols &amp;&amp; evaluations).\\n* **Visibility**(e.g.,**Agent
      IDs**, activity logging, cooperation-relevant capability evals, RL**reward reports**).\\n*
      **Security &amp; robustness**(e.g., access control tiers, adversarial robustness
      testing,**sandboxing**, rapid response for adaptive defense).\\n* **Societal
      integration**(e.g.,**liability regimes**, commitment devices/smart contracts,
      equitable agent access schemes,**law-following agents**).Each category includes
      plain-language vignettes showing how a measure works in practice (pp. 36\u201347).\\n*
      **Two futures.**\u201CAgent-Driven Renaissance\u201D vs. \u201CAgents Run Amok\u201D
      scenarios make the stakes concrete\u2014highlighting the need for IDs, logging,
      rollbacks, defensive agents, and access/benefit-sharing (pp. 10\u201313).\\n*
      **Research &amp; capacity gap.**Few teams are working on agent governance relative
      to the resources pouring into capability-building; the guide flags funders,
      workshops, and priority research threads (pp. 5\u20137, 31\u201335, 48\u201350).\\n(See
      the**taxonomy table**on p.6 and pp. 36\u201347 for detailed exemplars;**agent
      architecture diagram**on p.14;**benchmark summaries**on pp. 18\u201321 and Appendix.)\\n#
      **\U0001F4A1 Why it matters?**\\nAgents aren\u2019t just chatbots\u2014they\u2019re**actors**.
      Once systems can plan, remember, and click \u201Cbuy\u201D (orexec), classic
      safety levers (content filters, pre-deployment evals) aren\u2019t enough. Governance
      must move**into the loop**: IDs and logs for traceability; rollback/shutdown
      for damage control; sandboxing and access controls for containment; liability
      and law-following to align incentives; and alignment methods suited to long-horizon,
      multi-agent settings. Building this stack**before**mass deployment is the difference
      between autonomous productivity and autonomous externalities. The report delivers
      a concrete, actionable blueprint. (See pp. 34\u201347.)\\n# **\u2753 What\u2019s
      Missing**\\n* **Operational maturity levels.**A readiness/assurance model (e.g.,
      Agent-ML levels with required controls/evals per tier) would help buyers and
      regulators phase adoption.\\n* **Quantified control efficacy.**The guide catalogs
      controls but offers limited empirical evidence on success rates (e.g., mean
      time-to-shutdown, rollback coverage, bypass rates).\\n* **Supply-chain specifics.**More
      detail on browser/OS, payment, and cloud co-regulation (who hosts agent IDs,
      where logs live, cross-jurisdiction handling).\\n* **Human factors.**Guidance
      for organizational design: who owns rollback authority, separation of duties,
      incident playbooks, and \u201Ckill-switch\u201D drills.\\n* **Evaluation economics.**Costs
      and sampling strategies to make agent evals reproducible at scale (the Appendix
      notes time/cost, but buyers need budgeting templates).## \U0001F465Best Fo**r**\\n*

      of agentic \\nartificial intelligence (AI) and the prospect of artificial \\ngeneral
      intelligence (AGI) create unprecedented \\nopportunities alongside complex governance
      challenges. \\nThis paper examines the ethical, regulatory, and technical \\ndimensions
      of governing highly autonomous AI systems, \\ndrawing upon more than fifty contemporary
      academic and \\npolicy sources. Three core insights emerge. First, current \\ngovernance
      structures provide limited coverage of risks \\nlinked to recursive self-improvement
      and multi-agent \\ncoordination, with only an estimated 10\u201315% of safety
      \\nresearch addressing impacts that arise after deployment. \\nSecond, economic
      projections suggest that agentic AI could \\ngenerate between 2.6 and 4.4 trillion
      USD in added global \\noutput by 2030, yet automation could replace \\napproximately
      28\u201342% of existing job tasks, making \\nproactive workforce transition
      strategies a policy necessity. \\nThird, fragmented regulatory approaches remain
      a concern; \\nin the United States, for example, 70\u201375% of critical \\ninfrastructure
      is considered vulnerable to adversarial \\nautonomous systems. To address these
      issues, we propose a \\ngovernance model built on three pillars: modular agent
      \\ndesign, adaptive safety mechanisms, and international \\ncoordination. Policy
      measures such as licensing thresholds \\nfor high-computer systems exceeding
      10^25 FLOPs, \\nstructured red-team testing across public and private \\nsectors,
      and fiscal incentives for governance-by-design \\npractices are advanced as
      actionable pathways. Overall, the \\nstudy argues for adaptive, globally coordinated
      governance \\nframeworks that balance innovation with systemic risk \\nmitigation
      in the era of agentic AI and AGI. his is a pure \\nreview paper and all results,
      proposals and findings are from \\nthe cited literature. \\nKEYWORDS- AI Governance,

      Policy, \\nRisk Management, Recursive Self-Improvement, Multi\\u0002Agent Systems,
      Workforce Transition, International \\nCoordination\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nThe
      emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014\\nsystems capable of
      autonomous goal-setting, decision\\u0002making, and task execution\u2014marks
      a fundamental \\nparadigm shift in computational intelligence. Unlike \\nconventional
      generative AI, which operates within static \\nprompt\u2013response frameworks,
      agentic AI demonstrates \\ndynamic adaptability, recursive self-improvement
      (RSI), \\nand multi-agent collaboration [1], [2]. These capabilities \\nenable
      agentic systems not only to generate content but also \\nto plan, execute, and
      optimize tasks with minimal human \\noversight. Parallel advancements in artificial
      general \\nintelligence (AGI) further amplify both the transformative \\npotential
      and systemic risks of these technologies. Current \\neconomic projections suggest
      that agentic AI could \\ncontribute between $2.6 and $4.4 trillion to global
      GDP by \\n2030, while simultaneously automating 28\u201342% of job\\u0002related
      tasks [3], [4]. Such forecasts underscore the dual \\nchallenge of harnessing
      productivity gains while mitigating \\nwidespread labor market disruptions.\\nDespite
      growing awareness, existing governance \\nframeworks remain ill-equipped to
      manage the \\ncomplexities of agentic AI and AGI. This paper identifies \\nthree
      central gaps in current approaches. First, regulatory \\nand ethical models
      provide insufficient guidance for \\naddressing risks associated with recursive
      self\\u0002improvement and autonomous multi-agent coordination. \\nSecond, regulatory
      fragmentation across jurisdictions \\nhinders coherent oversight; in the United
      States alone, \\nestimates indicate that 70\u201375% of critical infrastructure
      \\nremains exposed to adversarial exploitation by autonomous \\nsystems [5].
      Third, policy tools remain largely static, \\nlacking the adaptive mechanisms
      necessary to keep pace \\nwith rapidly evolving agentic technologies.\\nTo address
      these issues, this paper synthesizes insights from \\nover fifty contemporary
      sources, including academic \\nliterature (32%), industry reports (28%), and
      government \\npublications (20%), with a particular emphasis on policy \\ndevelopments
      in 2024\u20132025, such as the European Union\u2019s \\nAI Act [6] and the United

      REVIEW\\nThe literature review presented in this study is based on a \\nsystematic
      synthesis of more than fifty sources, \\nencompassing academic journals, industry
      reports, \\ngovernment publications, conference proceedings, and \\ntrade media.
      The objective of this review is to capture the \\nevolving technical, ethical,
      and policy dimensions of \\nagentic artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial
      general \\nintelligence (AGI) governance across multiple \\nperspectives.\\nAcademic
      journals constituted the largest share of reviewed \\nmaterials, accounting
      for approximately 32% of the \\nsources. These works were primarily drawn from
      peer\\u0002reviewed venues such as IEEE Computer [8], specialized \\noutlets
      focusing on robotics, safety, and alignment [4], and \\nprominent policy journals.
      The emphasis of this body of \\nwork was on technical architecture (15%), governance
      \\nframeworks (10%), and quantitative risk analyses (7%), \\nproviding the theoretical
      and conceptual foundation for \\nsubsequent developments.\\nIndustry contributions
      represented 28% of the corpus, with \\ninfluential white papers from technology
      corporations such \\nas IBM [9] and Deloitte [10], alongside reports by global
      \\nthink tanks including the Global Skill Development Council \\n(GSDC) [5].
      These reports concentrated on market \\nprojections (12%), deployment case studies
      (9%), and \\nemerging self-regulation standards (7%). Although industry \\nsources
      provided pragmatic insights into implementation, \\nthey also reflected a tendency
      toward optimism regarding \\nscalability and adoption.\\nGovernment publications
      accounted for 20% of the \\nreferences, with key contributions including analyses
      of the \\nU.S. Executive Orders on AI [7], the European Union\u2019s AI \\nAct
      [6], and the United Nations\u2019 perspectives on AI \\ngovernance [11]. These
      materials collectively focused on \\nregulatory frameworks (14%) and national
      strategies (6%), \\noffering a policy-oriented complement to technical studies.
      \\nIn parallel, conference proceedings and preprints comprised \\n12% of the
      literature, particularly from NeurIPS workshops \\non AI safety and IEEE Symposia
      addressing AGI \\ngovernance. These emerging works provided insights into \\nalgorithmic
      innovations (8%) and governance prototypes \\n(4%), reflecting the experimental
      stage of research in this \\narea. Finally, 8% of the sources were derived from
      news \\noutlets and trade media such as TechRadar [12] and \\nMarkTechPost [13].
      These contributions highlighted real\\u0002world deployments (5%) and expert
      interviews (3%), \\nserving as a bridge between academic analysis and public
      \\ndiscourse.\\nIn terms of temporal distribution, nearly half of the \\nreviewed
      works (50%) were published in 2025, reflecting \\nthe intensification of debates
      surrounding agentic AI \\ndeployment, risk analyses [18], and U.S.-specific
      \\nregulatory actions [19]. A further 32% were concentrated in \\n2024, coinciding
      with a surge in ethical frameworks [16] \\nand global policy proposals [11].

      Preparing for AI Agent Governance\\n### A research agenda for policymakers and
      researchers\\n![] \\nJacob Pratt\\nSeptember 30, 2025\\n![$hero_image['alt']]
      \\n### Key Takeaways\\n* **How AI agents will impact society is still uncertain.**While
      the body of scholarly work and publicly available evidence are growing, we don\u2019t
      yet know enough about how AI agents will be used or what impacts they may have.
      However, AI investments continue to soar, so policymakers should begin to prepare
      now.\\n* **Policymakers should prioritize evidence and information gathering,
      including through sandboxes and testbeds.**Given this uncertainty, policymakers
      should promote activities to generate evidence, rather than advancing prescriptive
      regulations. Promising options policymakers can use to build expertise and track
      developments are sandboxes and testbeds, which enable experimentation of new
      systems under regulatory supervision.\\n* **Subsequent rule-making will require
      substantial research from inside and outside of government.**Academia, civil
      society, government, and industry should work together to generate evidence
      on AI agents&#8217; capabilities, risks, societal impacts, and potential policy
      interventions. This will support future policy development.\\n* **This paper
      provides a roadmap for this research.**We outline three foundational requirements
      for governing AI agents and detail a comprehensive research agenda, including
      12 top-level and 45 sub-level questions, designed to directly support policymakers
      in developing evidence-based policy.\\nIndustry leaders have named 2025 the
      \u201Cyear of agentic exploration,\u201D foretelling the adoption of systems
      that will change how we interact, what jobs we perform, and even how we think.
      However, these innovations face significant hurdles: widespread AI agent adoption
      has been stifled by persistent reliability and security challenges, giving policymakers
      an opportunity to prepare thoughtfully for how to promote the benefits and protect
      against the risks of AI agents.\\nMaking the right public policy decisions on
      AI governance, including on the institutions, policies, regulations, and tools
      that ensure that AI systems operate in the public interest, requires substantial
      research and evidence. Though there is significant research done on AI more
      broadly and the theoretical impacts of AI agents, we don\u2019t yet know enough
      about how AI agents will be used or what impacts they may have. The key challenge
      for policymakers is not whether to regulate now, but how to govern AI agents
      while their impacts are still uncertain, and understand what evidence will be
      needed to make informed decisions when decisive action is needed.\\n> The key
      challenge for policymakers is not whether to regulate now, but how to govern
      AI agents while their impacts are still uncertain.\\n**In this paper, we outline
      a research agenda to guide policymakers and researchers in preparing for the
      governance of AI agents.**Structured around three core technology governance
      requirements for policymakers &#8211; foundational understanding, impact assessment,
      and intervention evaluation &#8211; we present 12 top-level questions and 45
      detailed open sub-questions from literature and partner discussions that policymakers
      and researchers should explore. We also explore how monitoring, sandboxes, and
      testbeds can be an important first step for policymakers.\\nPAI has already
      started conducting research that supports this agenda, and have recently published
      work on[prioritizing real-time failure detection] and[global governance]. We
      will continue to build on this work, and look forward to collaborating with
      our community to advance AI agent governance.\\nDownload the full research agenda
      and be a part of guiding evidence-based AI agent governance now.\\n[Back to

      [HTML (experimental)] > > Abstract:\\n> This position paper argues that AI agents
      should be regulated by the extent to which they operate autonomously. AI agents
      with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks
      of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations
      often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we argue that
      such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by agents whose
      capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our
      position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from scientists
      regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of using action sequences
      -- which reflect the degree of an agent&#39;s autonomy -- as a more suitable
      measure of potential impact than existing metrics that rely on observing environmental
      states. Comments:|Updated to improve the overall clarity with additional recent

      field of AI agent governance. Agents - AI systems that can autonomously achieve
      goals in the world, with little to no explicit human instruction about how to
      do so - are a major focus of leading tech companies, AI start-ups, and investors.
      If these development efforts are successful, some industry leaders claim we
      could soon see a world where millions or billions of agents autonomously perform
      complex tasks across society. Society is largely unprepared for this development.
      A future where capable agents are deployed en masse could see transformative
      benefits to society but also profound and novel risks. Currently, the exploration
      of agent governance questions and the development of associated interventions
      remain in their infancy. Only a few researchers, primarily in civil society
      organizations, public research institutes, and frontier AI companies, are actively
      working on these challenges. Subjects:|Computers and Society (cs.CY)|\\nCite

      generated by Bing## Executive Summary\\nThe discourse surrounding Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) Agentic systems in July 2025 is rife with both immense promise
      and considerable misunderstanding. A critical distinction has solidified: on
      one hand, there are sophisticated AI-powered tools that automate predefined
      workflows, often mislabeled as \u201Cagents\u201D; on the other, there are truly
      autonomous AI agents capable of independent decision-making and goal execution.
      While the former offers significant, achievable efficiency gains, the latter,
      though rapidly advancing, remains in a \u201Cresearch preview\u201D phase for
      high-stakes applications, necessitating a pragmatic approach to adoption.\\nLeading
      technology players like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta are actively deploying
      and integrating autonomous agent capabilities. These agents demonstrate impressive
      abilities, from automating complex web tasks and office chores to orchestrating
      multi-step personal projects and generating advertising content. However, their
      current limitations are clear: they struggle with sensitive, high-stakes tasks,
      complex interfaces, and certain web access restrictions, often requiring human
      oversight for critical actions.\\nEnterprise adoption is accelerating, with
      a substantial majority of executives already deploying or planning to deploy
      AI agents, driven by the perception of significant competitive advantage. This
      adoption often follows a pragmatic, risk-mitigated approach, starting with rule-based
      processes and incorporating robust human-in-the-loop oversight. The regulatory
      environment, particularly the EU AI Act, is shaping deployment strategies, emphasizing
      data governance, transparency, and accountability, which are critical for building
      trust. Despite the hype, confidence in fully autonomous agents has declined,
      highlighting a \u201Ctrust gap\u201D that organizations must address through
      ethical governance and explainability.\\nThe realistic return on investment
      (ROI) for AI agents extends beyond immediate cost reductions to encompass substantial
      gains in operational efficiency, productivity, enhanced customer experience,
      and accelerated innovation. While quantifying ROI can be complex, early adopters
      are reporting measurable value and a significant competitive edge. The path
      forward for AI Agentic involves a continued focus on addressing technical limitations,
      navigating ethical complexities, and fostering a collaborative human-AI operational
      model to unlock its full transformative potential, moving beyond aspirational
      \u201Cfull autonomy\u201D to achievable, impactful augmentation.\\n## 1. Demystifying
      AI Agentic: What Are True Autonomous Agents?\\nThe term \u201CAI Agentic\u201D
      has become a prevalent buzzword, often leading to confusion regarding the actual
      capabilities of various AI systems. As of July 2025, a clear definition has
      emerged, distinguishing between AI-powered tools that enhance existing processes
      and genuinely autonomous AI agents that operate with independent decision-making
      authority. Understanding this distinction is crucial for strategic planning
      and avoiding the \u201Cinnovation theatre\u201D that can fuel unrealistic expectations
      [30].\\n### 1.1 Defining AI Agents: From LLMs to Autonomous Decision-Making\\nThe
      fundamental concept of AI Agentic, as understood in July 2025, centers on*autonomous
      agents*. These are systems designed to receive a high-level goal and then independently
      execute multiple operations, including making choices and potentially initiating
      actions such as payments [30]. This capability represents a significant advancement
      beyond traditional AI tools. For instance, OpenAI describes its agents, including
      the newly integrated ChatGPT Agent (formerly Operator), as \u201CAIs capable
      of doing work for you independently \u2014you give it a task and it will execute
      it\u201D [1]. This directly aligns with the principle of autonomous execution.\\nPress
      enter or click to view image in full size\\n![] \\nThe Agentic mode in ChatGPT\\nLarge
      Language Models (LLMs) serve as foundational components, acting as the \u201Cbrains\u201D
      or \u201Creasoning engines\u201D that enable these autonomous solutions. However,
      it is important to recognize that LLMs themselves are not the agents. The evolution
      of AI has seen LLMs overcome their inherent limitations, such as poor calculation
      abilities or fixed training data, by gaining the capacity to interface with
      external tools. This includes calling a calculator for complex mathematical
      operations, retrieving information from external document collections via architectures
      like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), connecting to the internet, or interfacing
      with email and notification systems [30]. This integration of tools was a pivotal
      step towards agentic behavior.\\nThe transition from LLMs as standalone processing
      units to LLMs functioning as enablers within larger, orchestrated autonomous
      systems signifies a fundamental architectural evolution in AI. This shift moves
      the primary focus of innovation from merely scaling model size to designing
      sophisticated system architectures and enhancing reasoning capabilities. For
      businesses, this implies that successful AI agent adoption will require more
      than simply acquiring access to the latest LLM. It necessitates a strategic
      emphasis on integrating these models into robust, tool-augmented architectures
      and developing a deep understanding of the system-level design required for
      truly autonomous operation. The future gains in AI are increasingly expected
      to come from \u201Csmarter algorithms\u201D and architectural innovation, rather
      than solely from building bigger models [2].\\nPress enter or click to view
      image in full size\\n![] \\nMulti agents interaction \u2014source[https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/]
      \\nThe rapid proliferation of the \u201CAI Agentic\u201D term, often misapplied
      to less autonomous systems, has created considerable market excitement and a
      sense of \u201Cfear of missing out\u201D (FOMO) among top management [30]. This
      dynamic necessitates a clear, grounded definition for effective strategic decision-making.
      The competitive pressures in the AI market incentivize companies to rebrand
      existing automation or LLM-powered tools as \u201Cagents\u201D to capitalize
      on the hype. This marketing-driven terminology can obscure the true capabilities
      for non-technical executives. Consequently, a critical component of any organization\u2019s
      AI strategy must involve thorough due diligence and an internal understanding
      of the actual functionalities of any \u201Cagent\u201D solution. Without this
      clarity, organizations risk misallocating resources, setting unrealistic expectations,
      and experiencing disillusionment, which could undermine broader AI adoption
      efforts.\\n### 1.2 The Critical Distinction: Programmed Tools vs. Autonomous
      Agents\\nA clear demarcation exists between programmed AI tools and truly autonomous
      AI agents, a distinction articulated through a software versioning analogy in
      the initial discussion.\\n**Programmed Agents (Version 2.1.0): The Achievable
      Automation**\\nThese systems are fundamentally \u201CRPA on steroids or RPA
      powered by GenAI\u201D [30]. They integrate LLMs with other LLMs or broader
      IT systems but operate with \u201Czero freedom of decision\u201D [30]. Their
      execution is \u201Cguided and controlled,\u201D strictly following \u201Cpredetermined
      tracks\u201D [30]. Frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph are instrumental
      in developing these more complex, multi-step workflows. Typical applications
      include automated document processing, email sorting, meeting summaries, and
      workflow management, where tasks are specific and circumscribed [4]. These solutions
      are \u201Cextraordinary and can truly help and improve many processes\u201D
      [30], delivering significant, measurable value within established operational
      frameworks.\\n**Autonomous Agents (Version 4.0.0): The Aspirational Frontier**\\nThese
      represent the genuine \u201CAgentic AI\u201D under discussion in 2025, characterized
      by true \u201Cdecision-making autonomy\u201D [30]. The user provides a high-level
      goal, such as \u201Cplan a weekend trip,\u201D and the agent independently performs
      all necessary operations, including navigating the internet, making choices,
      and potentially initiating payments [30]. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Agent, launched
      on July 17, 2025, is presented as a leading example of this paradigm shift.1
      Other key players include Google DeepMind, with AlphaEvolve optimizing algorithms
      and Project Mariner automating web tasks, and Anthropic, which develops Claude
      agents for complex problem-solving [5].\\nThe versioning analogy used to illustrate
      this evolution is as follows from [30]:\\n* **Version 2.1.0:**Represents programmed
      agents, where individual LLMs are guided to perform specific, circumscribed
      tasks.\\n* **Version 3.0.0:**Marks the emergence of reasoning engines, such
      as OpenAI\u2019s o1 (launched September 2024), which natively integrate complex
      architectures to increasingly approximate human-like reasoning.\\n* **Version
      3.1.0:**Encompasses open-source advancements in reasoning, notably accelerated
      by projects like DeepSeek\u2019s R1.\\n* **Version 4.0.0:**Denotes truly autonomous
      agents that not only have access to tools but \u201Cautonomously choose which
      to use and which decisions to take\u201D .\\nThe evolution from programmed tools
      to autonomous agents signifies a fundamental shift from the automation of*steps*to
      the automation of*goals*. This fundamentally alters how businesses can approach
      process optimization and problem-solving. Programmed agents are designed\\nSummary:

      research conducted on autonomous AI agents, highlighting their potential to
      enhance productivity and operational efficiency while addressing emerging challenges
      related to ethical governance and reliability.):\\n### Summary of Key Findings
      on Autonomous AI Agents (2025)\\n\\n**Overview**\\nThe advancements in autonomous
      AI agents in 2025 highlight their potential to significantly enhance productivity
      and operational efficiency across various industries. Alongside this potential,
      emerging challenges in ethical governance and reliability are becoming increasingly
      apparent.\\n\\n#### **1. Enhancing Productivity and Operational Efficiency**\\n-
      **Integration into Workflows**: Autonomous AI agents are recognized as transformative
      tools, shifting from standard automation to sophisticated entities capable of
      executing complex tasks autonomously. They eliminate mundane tasks, enabling
      employees to focus on higher-level initiatives.\\n- **Substantial ROI**: Companies
      leveraging AI agents report efficiency gains of 30-80%, with measurable increases
      in productivity, cost savings, and improved decision-making processes. For instance,
      PwC's survey highlights that 66% of businesses adopting AI agents see tangible
      productivity benefits.\\n- **Examples of Applications**: Industries such as
      finance and healthcare are adopting AI agents for tasks like processing invoices,
      managing patient schedules, and conducting complex R&D tasks. These applications
      streamline operations and drive down costs.\\n\\n#### **2. Ethical Governance
      Challenges**\\n- **Accountability and Trust**: As AI agents take on more autonomous
      roles, the necessity for robust governance frameworks becomes paramount. Organizations
      must navigate challenges such as unbounded autonomy, opaque decision-making
      processes, and risks associated with multi-agent systems.\\n- **Dynamic Governance
      Frameworks**: Traditional governance models are inadequate for managing the
      fluidity and complexity of AI agents. New approaches must include continuous
      monitoring, accountability measures, and mechanisms to ensure compliance with
      ethical standards.\\n- **Policy Recommendations**: Essential guidelines include
      defining the scope of autonomy for agents, enhancing transparency in their decision-making
      processes, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Research suggests
      that policymakers should prioritize evidence gathering through supportive structures
      like testbeds and sandboxes.\\n\\n#### **3. Addressing Reliability Concerns**\\n-
      **Emergent Risks**: The deployment of AI agents is accompanied by risks including
      decision drift, coordination conflicts among multiple agents, and potential
      ethical violations. The governance of these systems must adapt to manage and
      mitigate these risks effectively.\\n- **Collaboration with Human Oversight**:
      Despite their capabilities, AI agents cannot function optimally without human
      involvement in high-stakes decisions. Balancing autonomy with human oversight
      is key to reducing risks and ensuring reliable performance.\\n\\n#### **Conclusion**\\nThe
      trajectory of autonomous AI agents in 2025 reveals a dual-edged sword: while
      they offer vast potential to redefine productivity and operational dynamics,
      they also raise significant ethical and reliability challenges that necessitate
      proactive governance and strategic oversight. As organizations integrate these
      agents, a focus on establishing trustworthy frameworks will be critical for
      harnessing their full capabilities while safeguarding against potential pitfalls.\\n\\nSynthesize
