      3.5 (PEP 492, 2015). Unlike JavaScript which is single-threaded by design, Python''s

      was a major inspiration for Python''s implementation. The GIL (Global Interpreter
      Lock) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple
      threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. This means CPU-bound
      multithreaded programs don''t benefit from multiple cores. PEP 703 proposes
      making the GIL optional in CPython.\n</conversation>\n\nCreate a summary with
