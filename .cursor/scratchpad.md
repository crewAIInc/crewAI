# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯

Current Task: Enhance the `CreateCrewForm` UI with Shadcn UI components.
Understanding:

- We'll replace the basic HTML elements (input, textarea, select, button) with their Shadcn UI equivalents.
- We'll need to install the necessary Shadcn UI components.
- We'll need to update the `CreateCrewForm.tsx` file to use the new components.
- We'll need to ensure that the styling and accessibility features are maintained.

Questions:

- Are there any specific Shadcn UI components that are preferred or required for this form? (Let's use the standard components: Input, Textarea, Select, Button, and potentially a Form wrapper).
- Are there any specific design guidelines or style preferences for using Shadcn UI components in this project? (We'll follow the default Shadcn UI styling for now, and we can customize it later if needed).

Confidence: 95%

Next Steps:

1. Install the necessary Shadcn UI components using the `shadcn-ui` CLI.
2. Update `CreateCrewForm.tsx` to import and use the Shadcn UI components.
3. Replace the existing HTML elements with the Shadcn UI components.
4. Ensure that all form functionality (data binding, validation, submission) is preserved.
5. Ensure that accessibility attributes are correctly applied to the new components.
6. Update `@memories.md`.
