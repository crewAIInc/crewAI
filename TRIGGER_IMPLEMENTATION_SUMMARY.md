# CrewAI CLI Trigger Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the trigger functionality for CrewAI CLI as requested, adding two main commands:
- `crewai trigger list` - Lists all triggers grouped by provider
- `crewai trigger <app/trigger_name>` - Runs a crew with the specified trigger payload

## Implementation Details

### 1. Extended PlusAPI Client (`src/crewai/cli/plus_api.py`)
- Added `TRIGGERS_RESOURCE = "/v1/triggers"` endpoint constant
- Implemented `list_triggers()` method for GET `/v1/triggers`
- Implemented `get_trigger_sample_payload(trigger_identification)` method for POST `/v1/triggers/sample_payload`

### 2. Created TriggerCommand Class (`src/crewai/cli/trigger_command.py`)
- Inherits from `BaseCommand` and `PlusAPIMixin` for proper authentication
- Implements `list_triggers()` method with:
  - Rich table display grouped by provider
  - Comprehensive error handling for network issues, authentication, etc.
  - User-friendly messages and styling
- Implements `run_trigger(trigger_identification)` method with:
  - Trigger identification format validation (`app/trigger_name`)
  - Sample payload retrieval from API
  - Dynamic crew/flow execution with trigger payload injection
  - Temporary script generation and cleanup
  - Robust error handling and validation

### 3. Integrated CLI Commands (`src/crewai/cli/cli.py`)
- Added import for `TriggerCommand`
- Implemented `@crewai.command()` decorator for `trigger` command
- Supports both `crewai trigger list` and `crewai trigger <app/trigger_name>` syntax
- Proper argument parsing and command routing

### 4. Key Features

#### Trigger Listing
- Fetches triggers from `/v1/triggers` endpoint
- Displays triggers in a formatted table grouped by provider
- Shows trigger ID and description for each trigger
- Provides usage instructions

#### Trigger Execution
- Validates trigger identification format
- Fetches sample payload from `/v1/triggers/sample_payload` endpoint
- Detects project type (crew vs flow) from `pyproject.toml`
- Generates appropriate execution script with trigger payload injection
- Executes crew/flow with `uv run python` command
- Adds trigger payload to inputs as `crewai_trigger_payload`
- Handles cleanup of temporary files

#### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures (401)
- Authorization issues (403)
- Trigger not found (404)
- Invalid project structure
- Subprocess execution errors
- Comprehensive user feedback with actionable suggestions

### 5. Usage Examples

```bash
# List all available triggers
crewai trigger list

# Run a specific trigger
crewai trigger github/pull_request_opened
crewai trigger slack/message_received
crewai trigger webhook/user_signup
```

### 6. API Integration Points

#### CrewAI Client â†’ Rails App
- GET `/v1/triggers` - Returns triggers grouped by provider
- POST `/v1/triggers/sample_payload` with `{"trigger_identification": "app/trigger_name"}`

#### Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "github": {
    "github/pull_request_opened": {
      "description": "Triggered when a pull request is opened"
    },
    "github/issue_created": {
      "description": "Triggered when an issue is created"
    }
  },
  "slack": {
    "slack/message_received": {
      "description": "Triggered when a message is received"
    }
  }
}
```

### 7. Crew/Flow Integration
The trigger payload is automatically injected into the crew/flow inputs as `crewai_trigger_payload`, allowing crews to access trigger data:

```python
# In crew/flow code
def my_crew():
    crew = Crew(...)
    result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)  # inputs will contain 'crewai_trigger_payload'
    return result
```

### 8. Dependencies
- `click` - CLI framework
- `rich` - Enhanced terminal output
- `requests` - HTTP client
- Existing CrewAI CLI infrastructure (authentication, configuration, etc.)

## Testing
- All imports work correctly
- CLI command structure is properly implemented
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Code follows CrewAI patterns and conventions

## Next Steps for Backend Implementation

### Rails App Requirements
1. Add `GET /v1/triggers` endpoint
2. Add `POST /v1/triggers/sample_payload` endpoint
3. Implement integration service method `summarize_triggers`
4. Each provider service must implement:
   - `list_triggers()` method
   - `get_sample_payload(trigger_identification)` method

### CrewAI OAuth Requirements
1. Implement endpoint that returns sample payload for trigger identification
2. Ensure trigger data format matches expected structure

The CLI implementation is complete and ready for integration with the backend services.
