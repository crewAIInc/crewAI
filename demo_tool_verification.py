Tool Execution Verification Demo

This script demonstrates the tool execution verification system by testing
real vs fake tool implementations. It shows how the system can detect when
tools are actually executing vs when they're fabricating results.

Usage:
    python demo_tool_verification.py

The demo will:
1. Test a real file writing tool that actually creates files
2. Test a fake file writing tool that only pretends to create files
3. Show the verification results for each
